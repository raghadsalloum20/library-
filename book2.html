<p class="drop-cap">BETSY sat staring
through
the window of
the first hack she
had ever been
in,—also it
was the first
she had ever
seen. She
was wondering,
wondering, as
she rolled along up
two-mile drive
that lay between
the station and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
Hill-Top, what would happen next. Things had
moved pretty swiftly in the past few weeks, and
Betsy had been simply a bewildered leaf floating
on the whirling tide of destiny.</p>

<p>To begin with, her father had disappeared;—run
away from the little farm on the New Hampshire
hillside. Tired of the stones and the drudgery—tired,
too, of the wife, who, through neglect,
hard work and lack of good food, had grown to
be a fretful invalid—he had disappeared like a
coward, in the night, no one knew where.</p>

<p>There were days after that when Betsy had
gone hungry, for there was no money in the house,
and but little food, and at last had come a day
when the mother had fallen weakly on the floor.
Betsy had run, frightened, down to old Mrs.
Webb’s house for help, and Mrs. Webb had told
the neighbors, and they had all come from every
direction, surprised by the alarming news. It
was planting season, and for some time no one
had happened to call at the little red house over in
Wixon’s Hollow, off the main road.</p>

<p>Then there had been a great bustling about.
Betsy’s mother was put to bed, a doctor had come,
there was food in the house once more, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
kindly neighbor took charge of affairs. But it
was too late. In a few days all was over.</p>

<p>But soon another leaf had been turned in
Betsy’s book of life by a letter from a distant
relative, known vaguely to Betsy as “Aunt Kate
Johns.” Betsy was invited to come and stay a
year with her.</p>

<p>Betsy had cried a little in secret over this, because
it was something unknown and consequently
something fearful. But one must take what
comes,—so the poor little belongings were packed
in a “carpet-bag,” and Betsy took her first railway
journey all alone. It would have been a marvelous
undertaking, but Betsy’s eyes were still
blinded with the tears of her loss.</p>

<p>And now here she was, and what would come
next?</p>

<p>She had never seen “Uncle Ben,” and Aunt
Kate had been simply a vision of lovely color and
soft silken draperies. Once or twice she had
whirled into the little red house, and away again.
Well, after all, it would be something new. Betsy
plucked up her courage and dried her last tear
as the hack turned in at a gate.</p>

<p>Up a wide avenue went the hack, under stately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
trees and between wonderful flower-beds and
sunny reaches of grass and dandelions. The
dandelions looked homely and dear, but the prim
magnificence of the great, park-like place awed
Betsy too much for other emotions. Uncle Ben
and Aunt Kate would probably be as stiff and
unlovable as that trimmed hedge over there. She
braced herself for the worst.</p>

<p>Now they drove past a great stone building,
full of winking eyes, which were really windows
peering into the sunset through a riot of vines.
That was the “Hospital,” no doubt, of which
Uncle Ben was superintendent. It looked huge
and mysterious, and out of the unknown future
Betsy felt a chill of loneliness creep over her.
The driver stopped at last before a pretty brick
house standing by itself in the park. It was all
nooks and gables, and around two sides of it
ran a porch delightfully shaded by honeysuckle.
Betsy did not know honeysuckle, but its sweet
smell hung heavy over her, and somehow it
heartened her as she mounted the steps.</p>

<p>She needed all the heartening she could get,
for Betsy had never before been beyond her own
New Hampshire valley. She wavered a little,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
and there was a queer, wooden-y feeling in her
legs as she lifted her hand and rapped on the dark
expanse of the door—she knew nothing of doorbells
or knockers, and did not even look for them.</p>

<p>Almost immediately the door swung open, and
a trim maid said:</p>

<p>“Is this Miss Betsy? Come right in. Mrs.
Johns is sick with a headache, but she heard the
carriage, and sent me to bring you up to her.
Give me your bag, Miss.”</p>

<p>Betsy gave up the carpet-bag doubtfully.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t bang it. I’ve got two fresh eggs
in it for Aunt Kate.”</p>

<p>Up a broad winding stair Betsy followed the
maid, and into a room all delicate green and gold,
with painted iris growing on the walls, up from
a thick carpet that was almost like the grassy
lawn. From a low couch came a soft voice.</p>

<p>“Come here, Betsy.”</p>

<p>The little figure stood stiffly before the couch,—a
thin, small wisp of a maid, with brown hair
of the silky kind that never stays “put”; the natural
sallowness of her complexion was deepened
by the tan of out-of-door life; the little hands
were reddened and roughened with dishwashing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
and scrubbing,—for Betsy had mothered her
mother ever since she was big enough to bring in
kindlings from the wood-pile. A faded black
frock, fashioned hurriedly from an old skirt of
her mother’s, made a pitiful attempt at mourning.</p>

<p>Most unpromising she was, at the first glance,
and Aunt Kate’s heart sank, until her eyes met
the two brown ones,—so deep and soft that she
gave a start. Pools of liquid darkness they were,
and out of them shone a soul to be trusted. Aunt
Kate held out two arms, lace-covered and delicate,
to enfold the small waif.</p>

<p>But Betsy did not accept the invitation. She
stood there, crossing her ankles, and not knowing
what to do with her hands. Caresses she had
never known. In a voice shrill with the excitement
of the interview, she said:</p>

<p>“I’ve brought you two eggs,—they’re fresh.
Speckly and Banty done ’em for you.”</p>

<p>Out of her poverty the child had come with
gifts! Aunt Kate’s eyes dimmed a little, and her
hand closed gently over the little red one that
hung limply at Betsy’s side.</p>

<p>“Did you bring them to me? I am so glad.
I love fresh eggs.”</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>Betsy pointed to the maid. “She’s got my
carpet-bag. Where’d you put it?”</p>

<p>“In your room, Miss Betsy.”</p>

<p>“<i>My</i> room? Have I got a room?”</p>

<p>“Show her, Treesa.”</p>

<p>Treesa led the way, and Betsy was soon back
with an egg in each hand.</p>

<p>“They’re all right. I didn’t let no man nor
nothin’ touch that bag coming down. Here they
are. They aren’t real cold yet, hardly. I shooed
Speckly off the nest to get this biggest one just
before the stage came for me.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, dear. They’re fine. This weeny
one is just like a big pearl. I hope you are going
to be happy here with us.”</p>

<p>“I dunno. I never had much time for it.”</p>

<p>The sharp little nine-year-old voice had the
edge of forty-five on it; it was the echo of her
mother’s fretful plaint which the child had unconsciously
picked up.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see. Run, now, and wash your
hands and face, and Treesa will give you some
supper in your room.” Somehow Aunt Kate
shrank from leaving her alone with Uncle Ben
this first night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>Betsy hesitated. “This room is handsomer
than our parlor,—but it’s kinder big and lonesome
here.”</p>

<p>“It won’t seem so when you get used to it.
We’re going to love you and then you will love
us and we’ll all be happy as larks. Now good-night,
little girl. You had better go right to
bed after your tea. Treesa will show you where
to put your things, and to-morrow will be a new
day, Betsy dear, and then we’ll have time to get
acquainted.”</p>

<p>Betsy walked to the door as if the interview
was closed.</p>

<p>“Won’t you come and kiss me good-night?”</p>

<p>The child came slowly, as if unaccustomed to
the rite, shrank a little from the arm that stole
about her, pecked the lips coldly; then, at the
soft caress of the white hand, she dropped a tiny
corner of her reserve.</p>

<p>“Ma kissed me just afore she died.”</p>

<p>Then Betsy froze again, and walked out of the
room.</p>

<p>Things passed in a whirl that evening. Whatever
Betsy thought of the dainty room, all in
white, old rose and soft, warm gray, she did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
disclose to Treesa. She ate her meal from delicate
china, with real silver, and at last climbed
into bed between the snowy sheets, and straightened
out the folds of her coarse, drilling nightgown
for sleep.</p>

<p>“It’s awful grand and beautiful here,” she
whispered to herself; “but I’ll be lonesome. I
wisht Ma was here, an’ I—I wisht I was back in
the Holler!”</p>

<p>She hid her face in the pillow when Treesa
came in, that her tears might not be seen.</p>

<p>“Good-night, Miss Betsy. Do you want a light
left in your room?”</p>

<p>“No’m. I allers go to sleep in the dark,” said
Betsy, bravely. She watched between her fingers
as Treesa pulled a little chain, and snap! out went
the light. At home they blew it out, and there
was a smell of kerosene or tallow afterwards.
This interested Betsy so much, wondering how it
was done, that she forgot to stay awake and
grieve through the dark hours, and before she
could have counted a hundred, the wings of
childish sleep were around her.</p>

<small>THE NEW SURROUNDINGS</small></h2>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“She sat up and looked
out of the window.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="drop-cap">BETSY awoke with a strange feeling of being
still in a dream. Instead of opening her
eyes on the little attic room of the red house in
the Hollow, she was greeted by what seemed to
her a palace in a fairy tale. She rubbed her eyes,
sat up, and looked out of the window.</p>

<p>Yes, it was true; instead of being in a hollow
she was on a hilltop. Stretched out below her lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
a green valley, and through the trees peeped
many, many houses, more than Betsy had ever
dreamed of in all her life. It must be a city, she
thought, but the pictures in her geography had
not prepared her for anything like this. The city
seemed to be sitting on a hillside, with its feet
dipping in the waters of a broad blue river. She
was quite awake now, and beginning to realize
what had happened.</p>

<p>Bang, bang, bang! There came a terrifying
sound. It might have been a church bell, but it
was too near; it might have been somebody
pounding on the brass soap-kettle at home, but it
was too musical. Betsy was out of bed like a
shot, just as Aunt Kate showed her smiling face
through a crack in the door.</p>

<p>“My goodness! What was that noise?” cried
Betsy.</p>

<p>“Just the rising gong, dear. I intended to
have wakened you before it sounded. You’ll have
just time to dress before breakfast. What are
you going to put on?”</p>

<p>“I got this dress I wore here, for best, and I
got a black and white check gingham for every
day. I had two blue calicoes and a red merino,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
but Mrs. Webb said I wasn’t to bring ’em, ’cause
they was colored, and I’m wearin’ black things.”
Betsy told off the items of her wardrobe in one
breath.</p>

<p>“Put on your gingham. It will do for now.
Have you some light shoes?”</p>

<p>“Only just these copper-toes. I stub ’em out
awful, and Pa didn’t b’lieve in no foolishness, he
said. Summertimes I go barefoot, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Dear me! Well, these will do until after
breakfast.”</p>

<p>Betsy dressed hurriedly, after having first been
introduced to a big porcelain bathtub, where she
was told to hop in this morning and every morning
thereafter, for a splash.</p>

<p>“Oh my! Can I learn to swim in it?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it isn’t wide enough for you.”</p>

<p>“It’s bigger’n where I tried to learn in the
brook. There wasn’t room in that pool for the
whole of me. I just kicked my legs and held on
to the bank, and then I kicked my arms, with
my legs on the bank. But I dunno if I really
learned.”</p>

<p>Aunt Kate laughed a merry laugh, and left her.
Betsy finished off her toilette by tying a rusty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
black ribbon on the end of her tight pigtail, and
was ready for breakfast.</p>

<p>At the table there was Uncle Ben to meet. He
was a tall, grave man, with a gray moustache,—much
older-looking than Aunt Kate; but there was
a twinkle in his eye as he shook Betsy’s hand.</p>

<p>“Good morning. I suppose this is Miss Betsy
Wixon?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said simply, and slipped into the
chair that Treesa pointed out to her. She contributed
nothing more to the conversation for the
present, but began to eat with the healthy appetite
of a child. Aunt Kate sighed as she saw her
bite off the biggest piece possible from her slice
of toast, stuff nearly half an egg into her mouth
at once, and drink her coffee noisily. If the service
impressed Betsy, she gave no sign; only after
Treesa had quietly finished her duties and retired
to the kitchen, did she offer a remark.</p>

<p>“Aunt Kate,—don’t your hired girl eat to the
table with you?”</p>

<p>She received her information on the subject
without comment, wiped her mouth on her sleeve,
paying no attention to the napkin that Treesa had
placed in her lap, pushed back her chair, slipped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
down, and, without waiting to be excused, walked
out upon the porch.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben’s eyes followed the queer little
figure.</p>

<p>“Your time won’t hang idle on your hands,
Kate, even if she’s good. Do teach her some
table manners, and get that black and white
Mother Hubbard thing into the waste basket.”</p>

<p>“Just wait, Ben, until to-night. There will be
a transformation on the surface, even so soon as
that. I’ve a scheme all worked out,—on a theory
that did not entirely originate with me. In fact,
I have already begun to work on it. I spent all
yesterday morning in the heat, shopping,—that’s
where I got my headache. When she begins to
connect the idea of self-respect with her appearance,
she’ll begin to try to live up to her looks.
There is splendid material there, and I’m going
to do the utmost with it. I need the child as much
as she needs me. I love her already, and this big
house will not be empty any more. She’ll respond,—you’ll
see.”</p>

<p>“I’ll trust you, Kate, to succeed in whatever you
start out to do. Just at present I will say that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
I’d rather have her around than forty just like
her.”</p>

<p>“You encourage me, Ben. By and by you will
applaud me. Watch!”</p>

<p>Later, when Dr. Johns had gone to his office
at the Main Building, Aunt Kate called Betsy in,
and together they mounted to the third floor,
where was a cosy sewing-room, with a high north
light. On a couch lay a number of pieces of
cloth.</p>

<p>“My, aren’t they pretty!” said Betsy.</p>

<p>“We are going to make some simple frocks for
you. Mrs. Allston is coming to-day to help.”</p>

<p>“For me? Why, I’m in mournin’ for Ma.”</p>

<p>“People—little girls—wear white, even when
they are in mourning, and we can save the colored
ones till a little later, if you prefer.”</p>

<p>“The pink’s the prettiest. It looks like the wild
roses in our back lot. But I shall have to wait.
Oh, well, I ain’t never had even a white dress
before. I can help you sew. I know how.”</p>

<p>“Do you? Why, that’s fine! Now here are
some underclothes for you to put on. I want you
to be all ready when Mrs. Allston comes to help
us sew.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>“These things? They got lace on.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Why, I’d tear ’em to bits, climbin’ trees.”</p>

<p>“If you can sew you’ll know how to mend them,
and you will learn to be careful. Now try on
these shoes.”</p>

<p>A pair of dainty strap-slippers were chosen,
with stockings to match, and soon Betsy was surveying
herself in the mirror.</p>

<p>“Have I got to wear ’em always?”</p>

<p>“Most people do, here.”</p>

<p>“Hm! They’ll feel funny. But I’ll get used
to ’em. Folks said you would likely ‘doll me up’
some. But I didn’t think there was such pretty
things in all the world. I’m afraid—I’m afraid,
Aunt Kate, that I won’t mourn so hard as I ought
to, with this lace on my petticoat.”</p>

<p>“You must think of how your mother would
have liked to see you in these pretty things. She
used to wear dainty, lace-trimmed clothes herself,
when she was little. And, dearie, she would not
want you to mourn. She’s so much happier now.
Just enjoy the things, and learn to make your soul
and body pretty, like the clothes.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Webb said I’d prob’ly get vain when you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
took me in hand,—but I guess I can resk one
small ‘vain.’ I can wear my black hair-ribbin, so
my head’ll mourn, anyway, and my feet’ll mourn,
too, in these black slippers.”</p>

<p>With this compromise they sat down, as soon
as Mrs. Allston had arrived, and Betsy’s nimble
little fingers ran with the best. Basting, back-stitching
and “over-and-overing” she could do,
and she soon learned the mysteries of hemming
and felling. So eager was she that her fingers
almost learned of themselves.</p>

<p>In the afternoon a tired but excited Betsy beheld
her first white frock, ready to wear.</p>

<p>“That will do for a start,” said Aunt Kate.
“Now, before you put it on, let us make sure that
everything else is all right. Will you let me do
your hair for you?”</p>

<p>Betsy submitted, and in a twinkling the tight
pigtail was unbraided.</p>

<p>“First we must get rid of the dust of the train.
Did you ever have a real shampoo?”</p>

<p>“No’m, I guess not. I never saw one.—Is it
side-combs?”</p>

<p>Aunt Kate laughed merrily.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>To Betsy’s surprise she was taken to the bathroom,
and introduced to the wonders of a beaten
egg, warm water, a delightful, soapy lather, more
warm water, then cold, and last, a brisk towel-rubbing
and fanning.</p>

<p>Out of it all the brown hair emerged, soft and
fluffy, with almost a desire to kink at the ends,
and a fresh black ribbon was tied jauntily into
the flowing meshes.</p>

<p>Betsy looked at herself critically.</p>

<p>“It seems like I was in a picter. But it’ll snarl
like sixty.”</p>

<p>“I’ll show you how to braid it nicely when you
are playing, but this is for Uncle Ben to see.
Now, just let me get the whole effect:—underwear,
stockings, slippers, hair,—all right, and
now the frock can go on.... Stop a minute,
though; let me look at your finger-nails.—My
little Betsy, we’ve some work ahead of us
here!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with ’em? I washed ’em.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see, dear. But did no one ever tell you
not to bite your nails?”</p>

<p>“No’m. Why, they’d get awful long if I didn’t,
and then I’d break ’em, washin’ dishes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“Well, I’ll make them look as nice as I can,
and you must promise me not to bite them any
more.”</p>

<p>Betsy hesitated.—“I’ll try,” she said at last,
“but I can’t promise,—not right off,—’cause I
bite ’em when I’m thinkin’ things. I couldn’t
promise nothin’ ’at I might forget.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, too. But you must do your best
to remember. Little girls must be nice in every
way.”</p>

<p>That evening, when Uncle Ben came to dinner,
he was greeted by an apparition all in white.
Betsy stood by her chair with a shy look at him,
to observe the effect of her transformation.</p>

<p>“As I live,—a fairy,—out of a story-book!
Or was there a fairy godmother somewhere, and
is this Cinderella? Where is the Prince?”</p>

<p>Betsy laughed and seated herself, and Aunt
Kate noticed that at the end of the meal she
reached down shyly, and wiped her mouth on the
corner of her napkin.</p>

<p>A week passed, and Betsy was clothed and
almost in her right mind once more, when Aunt
Kate came in one morning, with a pretty notebook
in her hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>“Now, Betsy dear, this is to be your book, and
I have put the word ‘Manners’ and a motto,—‘Manner
maketh the Man’, at the top. One of
the most important things is the way we eat our
meals, and I think it will be easier for you if I
do not speak to you at the table. But afterwards
we will come up to your room for a minute, all
by ourselves, and I will tell you what you have
done that is not just right, and you can write it
down in this book. Then we will practice with
knives and forks and spoons, and make believe
eat. At the table I’ll watch you, and you may
watch me, and if you see anything that seems
queer to you, please ask me about it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t I eat all right?”</p>

<p>“Well,—you have some things to learn.”</p>

<p>“Ma never had time to learn me much. We
just <i>et</i>, and that was all they was to it.”</p>

<p>“Have you noticed anything that we do differently
here from what you have seen at home?”</p>

<p>“One or two, yes’m. That about the napkin,
and, now, Uncle Ben, he don’t never eat his meat
with his knife,—he just cuts it and takes it on
his fork; and you don’t never turn your coffee in
your saucer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>“Good, Betsy! Why, you’ll learn so fast that
it will be simply play.”</p>

<p>As Aunt Kate rose to leave the room her hand
rested for a moment on the soft brown hair. At
the new touch of tenderness the child looked up
and met a glow in Aunt Kate’s eyes—a look of
mother-yearning. Something stirred in Betsy’s
heart,—an impulse to seize and hold that gentle
hand in both her own. But she did not quite dare—yet.
Down where Aunt Kate could not see she
caught a fold of the muslin gown that brushed
past her, and crushed it with timid fingers.</p>

<p>So the lessons in manners began. Grammar
could wait a bit. Aunt Kate did not intend to
cram Betsy, for a little at a time is easier to
digest.</p>

<p>And in the meantime, down in New York City,
something was happening that was to color all
Betsy’s new life on the Hill-Top.</p>

<small>THE COMING OF THE PRINCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">VANART VI. sat on the edge of his dish,
with all of his four paws in the milk, and
barked fiercely at his small sister, who hovered,
shy and meek, on the farther edge of Elysium.
He knew what all dogs (and some men) know,
that Might is Right; and he reasoned, not uncleverly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
that if his four-weeks-old voice could
intimidate Sister Belle, he could certainly keep her
off until he had feasted and made sure of his own
share.</p>

<p>A ray of afternoon sunlight crept in through
the skylight of the big New York studio, and
lighted up this scene, just as Bob Grant opened
the door, looked for the cause of the commotion,
dropped his parcel of sketches on the floor, and
laughed.</p>

<p>“You greedy little sinner! Is that the kind of
a dog you are going to be? You’ll be needing
some discipline, I’m thinking. Come here to me,
you young nipper.”</p>

<p>The wee morsel looked up for an instant, beheld
Bob Grant, and continued barking—at <i>him</i>.
He held his head royally, too, as if he knew that
he was the King of Hearts, bearing a noble name,
and with a long pedigree behind him.</p>

<p>“Why, you’re a raving beauty, even now. And,
if I am not mistaken, you’re mine. Who your
young companion is I don’t know. I hope to
Goshen Billy didn’t send me the two of you!”</p>

<p>No thought of a master entered Van’s mind
at that time. His attention was on the milk, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
so intent was he on asserting his rights, that he
quite forgot to drink. The Dog in the Milk was
evidently first cousin to the “Dog in the Manger.”</p>

<p>Bob opened the letter that was tied to the
basket in which the puppies had arrived. Uppermost
lay the register of birth and ancestry. It
read like this:</p>

<p>“Vanart VI.:—born March 26th, 1902.
Smooth fox-terrier. Color—white, with chestnut-brown
head and saddle and spot at base of
tail.”</p>

<p>Then followed his father’s name, Vanart I.;
his mother’s, Queen Mab, and a long list of forefathers
and foremothers. Bob Grant read, and
learned that Vanart I. was born in the Royal
Victoria Kennels at Montreal; that <i>his</i> father was
the famous Rex, which means king;—all down
the line appeared royal names.</p>

<p>So it was apparent that our hero was very well
born indeed,—a prince of the blood, and heir by
grace of his own personal beauty and attractions
to his great father’s title. The latter fact was
explained in the letter that lay underneath the
register:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>“Dear old Bob:—So sorry not to find you in,
and I wish I might stay to know what you think
of the puppy. The janitress let me in, and I’ve
fixed things up as well as I could. I don’t believe
they will do much damage before you return.
You know I promised you one sometime, and
here he is.</p>

<p>“His mother is Queen Mab, of the Newark
Kennels, and as this is the fifth year of my Van’s
fatherhood, your treasure’s full name is Vanart
VI.... He wins the title, as he is the pride and
beauty of the family.</p>

<p>“I think you will like him because he is marked
something like his father. Please pardon me for
bringing his sister Belle with him; the mother
could not take care of so many.</p>

<p>“I will come after Belle in a day or two. I hope
you’ll like your gift. Good luck to you,—Billy.”</p>
</div>

<p>Bob laid aside the letter and turned his attention
once more to the problem at his feet. No
doubt at all as to which was his own puppy. Bob
picked Van out of the dish, wiped the milk off
his feet, and introduced himself.</p>

<p>Van did not cringe, or try to get away, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
looked up from the big hand that held him, into
the face of the young man, with a fearless confidence,
and fell to chewing Bob’s finger, as if it
were the whole business of life.</p>

<p>“Well, Vanart VI., you are here, and I hope
a kind Providence will tell me what to do with
you. For the present I’ve got to put up with you
somehow. Two of them,—Oh, Christmas!”</p>

<p>“Woof!” said Van, affably, and he bit Bob’s
thumb a little harder, just to show him that the
chosen son of Vanart I. and Queen Mab was not
to be trifled with, and that, in reality, he owned
Bob. But the merry little eyes twinkled gayly,
as if, after all, this being the Lord of Creation
was a good joke.</p>

<p>For two weeks—while he was getting his
breath, you might say—Van lived in the big New
York studio with Bob Grant. Every day he grew
in grace, and became, more and more, a shapely,
active little dog. Beautiful indeed he was. Even
in his young puppyhood he was lithe and agile as
a kitten. His feet were small, as became his birth
and breeding; he carried his brown head proudly
on his delicate neck, that arched as none but a
thoroughbred’s might. His soft, pointed ears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
were alert to all the new noises of a strange and
interesting world, and he wagged, or was wagged,
by a funny bud of a tail, which every well-brought-up
fox-terrier knows is the style in good society.
His chest was broader than that of the ordinary
breed, and his eyes were dark and tender; and
one who knew dogs understood at a glance that a
strain from some far-away bull-dog ancestor had
added kindliness and affection to the sometimes
ill-tempered disposition of a full-blooded fox
terrier.</p>

<p>In those two weeks Van learned many things.
One was that pins are not good things to play
with. Bob came in one day and found him on
his back, making queer little sounds through a
rigidly open mouth, at which he was pawing
frantically to rid himself of something. Lodged
between his upper and lower molars was a pin
which he had tried to swallow. Bob removed it,
and then Van barked and capered as if he had
done a clever thing. But he knew also that it
was a thing not to be repeated.</p>

<p>The next thing he learned was that sisters do
not stay with one always. One day little Belle
disappeared,—going out of the big New York<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
studio on the arm of Billy, never to return. Van
did not mind that so much. His short life had
been all surprises so far, and he liked being cock-o’-the-walk
far better than sharing the glory.</p>

<p>So Belle faded from his little brain, like the
other visions of his border-land, and he quite forgot
her in the excitement of the new and wonderful
things that he was learning. Until now the
world had been a constant series of changes, and
more were to come; for so far he knew nothing
of the big out-of-doors.</p>

<p>Billy came in one evening, and stood looking
down at the bonny bit as he lay in his basket.</p>

<p>“Have you taken him out in Madison Square,
yet, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Not yet. I’ve been too busy.”</p>

<p>“Get on your hat and we’ll show him the town.
I’d like to see how he will behave.”</p>

<p>He was wakened, yawning and blinking,
crumpled gently under his master’s arm, and they
all went out into the soft May night.</p>

<p>First there was a long, bewildering street, full
of noises and lights that stunned and blinded the
little Prince. For a moment he hid his head in
the folds of Bob’s jacket, and felt like whimpering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
at the bigness of things. He himself was so
small and new, and all this must have been there
before he came. He would certainly have to
run to catch up. Well, running was fun. He
straightened up, settled himself comfortably, and
prepared to enjoy real living, no matter what
happened.</p>

<p>People who passed looked admiringly at the
uplifted, bobbing brown head, and the wide-open,
beautiful eyes that were awake to everything.
Some even stopped and patted him. He barked
joyously in response, and turned to fresh adventures.</p>

<p>And they came. Out of the street they turned
into a bigger and wider one. Then there opened
out in front of them a great square place,—a
place with houses all around, and a roof very
different from that in the studio. It was soft and
dark and green, and it waved and rustled in the
night breeze. There were many twinkling lights,
and many, many people. Some were moving
swiftly, some slowly. Others were gossiping or
nodding on benches. It was all very wonderful.</p>

<p>Then, most astonishing of all, Van’s four little
paws were set down on a fuzzy, wet, cold carpet;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
and he stood alone in the very middle of the
whole wide world. Bob and Billy were simply bystanders;
no hand was upon him to restrain him;
all this was his,—the trees, the lights, and the
starry dome above. Life began to unfold.</p>

<p>Afraid? Not he! He started at once on a
voyage of discovery. There were children there—the
first he had ever seen. They beckoned and
called to him, and he trotted to them. They
chased him and he scampered after them, barking
at their heels. He explored the grass-plots
and a pansy bed; he looked wonderingly at the
fountain that rose and fell with a throb of hidden
power,—always falling and yet always there; at
the round basin of water that was like nothing so
much as a giant milk dish.</p>

<p>Then he started for the people who were sitting
in amused groups on the benches, even the
sleepy ones waking up to watch the dainty little
sprite.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet it’s his first night out,” said one fat
old man who had been reading a newspaper under
an electric light, “but he’s game to his ear-tips.”</p>

<p>“He’s a sport, all right,” said another. “See
him go for that cross old woman over the walk!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>The cross old woman looked down to see a
small brown and white puppy sitting confidingly
on the edge of her faded skirt. She made a movement
as if to jerk it away, looked again, then
stooped and patted the winsome little head. Van
seemed friendly. She stooped and picked him
up, and for a moment held him to her bosom,
where nothing had lain since the days when her
hair was brown and her cheek smooth and rosy.
He looked into her eyes with his soft young brown
ones, and all the bitter hardness faded out of
her face, as his delicate tongue flashed across the
tip of her nose. Then he gently nipped her hand,
and struggled to be off on fresh voyages of
discovery.</p>

<p>Bob called to him, but he glanced at him defiantly,
and ran in the other direction. The fat
man moved off down the walk, saying to others
as he went:</p>

<p>“Have you seen that pup over yonder? He’s
sure some pup! Ha, ha! He’s the whole show.
Better have a look.”</p>

<p>A crowd collected to watch the tiny joyous
thing: the old-timers who studied the want and
employment “ads”; the other shabby ones who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
were busy swapping politics; the still shabbier
ones who slept there with their arms folded, their
stubbly chins on their soiled shirt-fronts; the
casual passer-by,—even the policemen strolled
up,—with an eye to preserving peace and order,
but remained to enjoy the fairy-like antics of this
new dweller in the world. Everybody forgot for
a little while that there were such words as “Keep
off the grass.”</p>

<p>Van leaped for a June beetle,—missed it; a
night moth winged by him,—he chased it on flying
feet, although his legs were still so young and
uncertain that he tumbled over every hummock
in his path. A child rolled a rubber ball toward
him; he seized it and bore it to the feet of his
master, and lay down to demolish it. Bob rescued
it, and Van attacked a stick that a bent old
man poked at him.</p>

<p>“You’re a bit of all right, and no mistake!”
said the old man. “I bet you can read the papers.
Want to try?” He pulled the evening sheet out
of his pocket, and presented it to his young
acquaintance.</p>

<p>Van closed his teeth on it, dragged it after him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
across the walk, and sent the fragments flying far
and wide.</p>

<p>Through the thickest of the crowd a seedy
young man with a furtive eye sidled to the inner
edge of the onlookers. His hand flashed out as
Van gamboled near, and then—there was no Van
on the dewy grass.</p>

<p>For a moment no one understood. It was all
so sudden that no one could tell who did it.—Yes,
there was one who did,—a policeman who
was there to watch for just that very thing. The
seedy young man had reached the outer edge of
the group and in an instant more would be speeding
down Twenty-fourth Street.</p>

<p>A big hand landed firmly on his coat-collar,
another went into his pocket, and out came Van,—dazed,
but thinking it all part of the great
game the world was playing for his benefit. It
was so quickly done that the crowd hardly
knew anything had happened, until those nearest
saw the thief wrench himself from the detaining
hand and disappear in the darkness. The policeman,
glad of the chance to be so near the small
performer, held Van in the flat of one palm, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
stroked him with the other, as he passed him over
to Bob.</p>

<p>“Here’s yer white elephant, young feller, and
a foine wan he is. Ye’re lucky to git him back.
Them dog-pinchers is mighty handy with their
hooks.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” said Bob. “They know a good
thing when they see it. A little more, and he
would have been lost.”</p>

<p>“A little more, and yer dog ’ud be performin’
in a circus a year from now. There’s manny a
wan av us ’ud be likin’ to keep him.”</p>

<p>Bob and Billy walked back to the studio, and
Bob said soberly:</p>

<p>“I like the little sinner, and it’s mighty good
of you to give him to me, but I can’t keep him
here. City’s no place for a dog, and an untrained
pup at that.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you send him up country?”</p>

<p>Bob thought a moment.</p>

<p>“Good idea! The very thing! Sister Kate’s
just acquired a kid,—adopted it, or something—up
at the Hospital, you know. The kid’ll be lonesome
on the Hill-Top, with no companions. Off
you go, Van,—I’ll take you up there to-morrow.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
Kate’ll be surprised all right. They have never
had a dog or a chick or a child before, in the
house, and it’ll do ’em good. Ha, ha! I can
see Dr. Johns’ eyes open; but he won’t turn him
out, for what Kate does ‘goes’ with the doctor,
and what Bob does ‘goes’ with Kate. Your
destiny is fixed, young fellow. Missionary work
for yours.”</p>

<small>BETSY MEETS VAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">LIFE moved on the wings of youth for Van,
and changes were many. The very morning
after the trip to Madison Square, Bob Grant
packed some things into a suit-case. It lay on
the floor, and Van could see into it by putting
his forepaws on the edge. Nay, he could do
more than that. When Bob came to put in his
handkerchiefs he found young Van sitting comfortably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
in the middle of his best silk negligée
shirt.</p>

<p>“So you’re planning to go too, mister! Well,
I’m planning to take you, but not in my suit-case.
There’s the covered basket all ready for you.
We’re going this very afternoon. You may have
thought this was home, but it isn’t. It’s only a
New York studio, where one earns his bread and
butter. When you get to your final destination
you’ll have all out-of-doors to chase your tail in,—that
is, if you ever have one long enough to
chase. It’s back to the old farm for you.</p>

<p>“But you’ve got to be mighty good, and
whether you stay there or not depends entirely
on yourself. I’m risking it because you are a
rummy little chap, and I think you will be just
bad enough to be lovable.”</p>

<p>Van cocked his head on one side, and lifted his
left ear straight up, listening as if he understood
every word. He barked very confidently at Bob,
and when the time came, he entered his basket
without protest. In a basket he had come to the
New York studio, and in a basket he would leave
it,—the proper way. The lid was shut and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
fastened, and Van started on his second railway
journey.</p>

<p>The rumble and jolting of the trolley car, the
jostling of the crowd at the station, the roaring,
purring, grinding and shrieking of the train were
nothing to him. He had been through all that
before when he was even smaller, and nothing
dreadful had come of it. Humans certainly make
a lot of fuss for nothing. So he slept peacefully,
as a prince should, only reminding his bearer that
he was alive by a tiny “Yap!” when the express
train made its one stop on the way.</p>

<p>There his basket was opened, and he chewed
Bob’s finger for a minute, then snuggled down
again, to awaken only when Bob stepped into a
carriage at the end of his railway journey.</p>

<p>In the carriage the lid of Van’s basket was
raised, and for the whole two-mile drive he sat
up and watched everything with polite interest,
but with no vulgar astonishment. His bonny
brown eyes missed nothing, however. At last
Bob jumped out, and as he went up the steps
of the honeysuckle porch, he closed the basket lid
and shouted:</p>

<p>“Kit! Kit! Where are you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>“Bob! You dear fellow! How did you happen
to get away? Are all the books in the world
illustrated, and you off on a holiday?”</p>

<p>“No, not all of ’em. Got to get right back.
I just ran up to bring a present for the kid you
wrote me about. Thought she’d be lonesome.
Where is she?”</p>

<p>“Upstairs. I’ll call her in a minute. What
have you got in that basket?”</p>

<p>“Look out! It bites,—go easy. There!
How’s that for a watch-dog?”</p>

<p>Out of the basket popped two pointed, velvety
brown ears, erect and courageous, then the whole
head, cocked on one side, eyes dancing with excitement,
beauty and breeding in every line.</p>

<p>“Bob! What a darling! But, oh, I can’t keep
him. It’s enough to ask Dr. Johns to let me keep
Betsy.”</p>

<p>“We have to take some risks in this life, you
know, Kate. Come on in and call the kid.”</p>

<p>Out on the carpet Van was tumbled, to be admired
at all points; and being a dog of parts,
the points were many—his smooth, shining,
snowy coat, with the chestnut-brown saddle, and
the delicate lines and curves so rare in puppies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
of his or of any age. Mrs. Johns gave one long
look, and said:</p>

<p>“I don’t believe Ben will say one word. I’ll
call Betsy. She’s a queer little mite, but I think
she’ll like him. Betsy! Betsy! Come here a
minute!”</p>

<p>Betsy came slowly down the stairs,—a very
different-looking Betsy from the weird little black-robed
figure of two weeks ago, but still awkward
and shy.</p>

<p>“Betsy, this is Uncle Bob. See what he has
brought you.”</p>

<p>Betsy looked.</p>

<p>“It’s a puppy! Pa wouldn’t have any dog to
our house. They et too much.”</p>

<p>“He’s yours, Betsy.”</p>

<p>“Mine? No, he isn’t. He can’t be. What’s
his name?”</p>

<p>“Vanart VI.,” said Bob. “Call him Van, for
short. Go to Betsy, Van.”</p>

<p>Betsy sat down on the lower step of the stair,
and Van ambled up, wriggling, almost to her,
when suddenly his eye fell on a member of the
group, who, being merely a casual visitor, had not
been taken into account at all. It was a huge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
yellow cat, three times as big as Van, who, in a
hand to hand, or claw to claw fight could have
made ribbons of his young lordship.</p>

<p>Instantly Van’s head went down, his tail to
“attention,” and with stealthy steps he went
slowly toward old Tommy. A quickening of his
heart told him that his father and his father’s
father’s had always chased cats. There was a
long line of sporting dogs behind him, and here
was game worthy of the blood.</p>

<p>Tommy’s yellow fur stiffened into bristles; his
tail grew big and threatening; he backed against
the dining-room door with a low growl and with
all claws set. Van gave one short “Woof!” and
started for him. Tommy, who had met many
dogs, large and small, and vanquished not a few,
was not sure that this courageous morsel could
be a real dog at all, and in that moment of hesitation
the day was lost. “R-r-r-r-r!” growled
Van, in an answering challenge, and Tommy
turned tail and darted through the door into the
dining-room.</p>

<p>That was enough. “The game is started, chase
it!” whispered the blood of his ancestors to his
pumping heart. Through the swinging door into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
the kitchen went a yellow streak; after it pelted
a barking thing of brown and white; out through
the screen door and down the steps,—it was Van’s
first experience with steps, and the cat was gaining.
He rolled down, picked himself up, and
was off again in the direction of his flying yellow
prey.</p>

<p>Around the corner of the house it disappeared,
but Van was hard on the scent. Soon the cat
was in sight again and in a fair way to safety.
A friendly apple tree was just ahead; Tommy
made one dash up the trunk and was safe in a
high crotch, whence he could look down on his
tiny foe and be ashamed of himself. Van, not
being a climber, stopped beneath the tree, yelping
like mad at the lost prize, while Mrs. Johns,
Bob and Betsy looked on, too helpless with
laughter to inform him, as they should have done,
that the sporting instinct should be held second
to kingly courtesy.</p>

<p>But Van had treed his first cat on the first run,
and the field of glory, without a question, belonged
to him.</p>

<p>When quiet was restored, Bob turned to Betsy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“What do you think of that, now? Don’t you
like him?”</p>

<p>“I dunno. I never had a pet, ’cept Speckly and
Banty, and they’re hens.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think you’ll like him when you get to
know him. Can we fix him up a place to sleep
somewhere around?” said Bob.</p>

<p>“We can keep him in the kitchen, until he gets
acquainted. Mary will look after him, and he
can sleep in the little tool-room off the back
veranda.”</p>

<p>Betsy made no move to go nearer or to play
with him, and Aunt Kate said aside, to Bob,</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it’s a mistake. She doesn’t seem
to care for animals. Ben’s away, and I don’t
know what he’ll say. Oh, Bob, I’m afraid you
will have to take him back.”</p>

<p>“Well, wait till morning, anyway, before you
decide. I’ll be here over Sunday.”</p>

<p>That night a big, soft bed of blankets was
made for Van on the floor of the tool-room. He
was given a supper befitting his age and state,
tucked up comfortably, and in one minute he
had dropped fast asleep, and was making up for
the excitement of the day past.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>In the night Betsy awakened to hear a pitiful
little cry. For a moment her thought was, “Ma’s
awake and needs me!” and she jumped out of
bed. She had so often, in her mother’s illness,
awakened to wait on her, that, still drowsy from
her sound sleep, she thought herself back in the
little red house. Then, as she stumbled over
unwonted furniture, she realized where she was.
Groping her way to the window, she listened.
The tool-room was directly below, and behind the
door of it Van was voicing his loneliness and
homesickness.</p>

<p>A wave of pity swept up in the heart of Betsy.
Here was this tiny dog left all alone to cry his
heart out, and here was she,—with friends,—yes,
but friends not like her own self, and living
a different life from what hers had been.</p>

<p>Barefooted and silent, Betsy opened the door
and crept softly out into the hall. Feeling her
way she went down the stairs, the soft rustle of
her little nightgown being the only sound that
broke the stillness of the house. Gently she
turned the key in the lock and stepped out on the
back veranda. In the tool-room Van was still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
rending deaf heaven. The door was unlocked,
and Betsy gently pushed it open.</p>

<p>Instantly the wailing ceased. A scamper of
little feet came toward her, and she felt the cold
little pads on her own as Van dug his foreclaws
into her nightgown, and tried to climb up. There
was no one to look now, and her own little homesick
heart leaped to meet his. Picking him up in
her arms, she lifted the upper layer of the blanket
bed, and sat down upon it, while the puppy
nestled close, with his nose tucked into her neck,
apparently asking for nothing better.</p>

<p>“I’m lonesome, too, Van. Maybe Aunt Kate’d
be mad if I took you upstairs. I guess I’ll just
stay here. There, you pore little feller,—it’s all
right. Your Betsy’s here!”</p>

<p>When, in the morning, after a long, vain search
for Betsy, Mrs. Johns opened the door of the
silent tool-room, she did not speak. She went
and hunted up Bob, who was taking a turn on
the porch before breakfast. Together they
peeped in, quietly.</p>

<p>“I wish Ben was here to see them!” she whispered.
Then, as they turned softly away, she
added,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>“You needn’t take him away, Bob. That’s
settled. It is the first thing that has really seemed
to open the child’s heart. We needed just that
key.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>VAN’S FIRST LESSONS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THUS began a new life for both Betsy and
Van. Gay, smiling days they were, and,
for the most part, full to the brim.</p>

<p>It was country all around the Hospital, which
was itself a big and famous one. Dr. Johns was
the head doctor, and when he said “Come,” people
came there to work, and when he said “Go,”
they went away. It had been a great venture for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
Bob to bring a little dog to a place where everybody
was serious and quiet and orderly. Dr.
Johns, in his way, was a sort of king on the Hospital
Hill, and had much dignity to keep up.
What would happen if a riotous little prince of
a dog should try to usurp Dr. Johns’ authority,
or upset his dignity? It would not do at all.</p>

<p>But there Van was, and Betsy had adopted
him for her own. So, when Dr. Johns came home
and met the new-comer, he was polite, as he
always was, but perhaps a certain warmth was
lacking. He remarked that Van was a very pretty
dog, but Betsy felt the chill of it, and she ran
away with her pet tucked under her arm.</p>

<p>“I think Betsy feels hurt a bit,” said Aunt
Kate.</p>

<p>“Hurt? How? I said nothing to hurt her.”</p>

<p>“I think you did not intend to, Ben, but your
manner toward the dog was none too cordial.
I think he is going to help us solve our problem
of Betsy.”</p>

<p>“Well, my dear, I cannot think that it is a
good plan for us to keep a dog at an institution.
It is a bad example.”</p>

<p>“But Betsy loves him, and she’ll be so disappointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
if he is sent away. I think he’ll be a
good little fellow, and he’s a thoroughbred, you
know, with a pedigree as long as your arm.”</p>

<p>“A thoroughbred, is he? And Betsy loves
him? Well, well, if Betsy wants him, and if you
want him, of course that settles it.”</p>

<p>“I think I saw a tear in her eye as she went
out,” said Mrs. Johns, pushing her point in the
path of least resistance.</p>

<p>“Hm! You did, did you? Well, you tell
Betsy for me that she may keep dogs all over
the place if she wants to. By the way, tell her
to bring him back again. I didn’t get a good
look at him.”</p>

<p>And the beauty of the wee rascal did the rest.</p>

<p>Dr. Johns practically gave him the keys of the
castle. He graduated by leaps and bounds from
first lessons in the kitchen, where a basket was
installed for him, and where he slept at night.
As soon as he was big enough to climb up and
down the steps of the honeysuckle porch, the
world outside was his also.</p>

<p>He was too small to take it all in as yet, for
a scamper across the grounds would have been
a good half-mile. There were four great buildings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
of brick and stone, and all around them grew
noble trees and beautiful flowers on green, velvety
lawns. There were ponds, too, swarming with
gleaming goldfish and pollywogs of all sizes,
where the big and little frogs croaked in the warm
spring evenings. Then there were long processions
of people,—patients from the Hospital,
who went out to walk every day when the sun
shone. Van liked these, and would stand and
bark with joy every time they went past. Also
he barked at the red squirrels that chattered back
at him from the trees, at the fat robins, who
pulled countless fat worms out of the ground to
feed to their greedy babies, and at the stately
blackbirds who stalked around on the same
errand. Together Betsy and Van roamed the
place over, unmolested.</p>

<p>It was joy to Van, just being alive. The sunshine
seemed to sparkle around his little white
body, as he rolled on the grass, or pawed at the
loose loam in the flower-beds; and it was a warm
caress, when, tired after a chase for butterflies,
he dropped, panting, at the foot of the steps
where Betsy sat.</p>

<p>Besides Dr. and Mrs. Johns and Betsy, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
Treesa the maid, there was in the house a cook,
Mary, who made nice things for people to eat,
and who was one of those dear Irish souls of
whom the world cannot have too many. She
knew where to place a cooky jar so that a little
girl could find her way to it unhindered, and she
knew also how to smuggle tid-bits to a little dog
who was supposed to live entirely on dog-biscuit
and milk. Then there was Thatcher, a convalescent
patient, who came over every day from the
Hospital to help with the work. Thatcher welcomed
the Prince as one who is grounded in the
knowledge of dogs.</p>

<p>“My father used to train dogs, Mrs. Johns,
and you’ll want him trained right, or he’ll be good
for nothing. I’d like to do what I can.”</p>

<p>“I shall be so thankful if you will. Now is
the time for his character to be made or unmade.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be glad to train him, ma’am.” Thatcher
straightened up and looked very grand and important,
and Aunt Kate felt a load roll from her
shoulders; for it was no mean responsibility to
bring up a puppy so that he should be an honor
to his fathers and an ornament to society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>So Thatcher began his own particular system
of training. His first idea was that a dog should
be taught the art of swimming.</p>

<p>Now, every dog knows how to swim without
being taught, but Thatcher thought it would be
pretty sport to see his Lordship go after sticks
and the like, and swim back with them in his
mouth. So one morning he tucked Van under
his arm, and carried him off to the pond, Betsy
following close at his heels.</p>

<p>This was something new. Van rather liked a
bath, when Mrs. Johns or Treesa soused him all
over in a tub of warm soap-suds, and rinsed him
and dried him with a towel. But a tub like this—all
wide and shiny, with blue sky at the bottom,
and green trees and red buildings standing on
their heads all around the edge,—this was not to
be taken lightly—it was too large an affair.</p>

<p>Van sniffed at the brim of it, put his paw in,
and drew it out again, wet and cold. He looked
up at Thatcher for an explanation, when all of
a sudden, without any preparation whatever, he
was picked up and thrown, as if he were a stone,
straight into the middle of the pond.</p>

<p>Down he went, gasping,—away under—down—down—swirling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
over and over. Then up he
came, kicking and spluttering. He shook the
water out of his frightened eyes, and struck out
for shore and Thatcher, whom he had not as yet
connected with the outrage. You would have
thought he had been swimming for years.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Good boy!” cried Thatcher. “Now
go after that stick.” He cast a bit of wood in.
“See that? Now go for it!”</p>

<p>Van looked at the stick, and then at Thatcher.
He may have thought of the poor stick that
doubtless would be compelled to swim back as
he had to, but he made no effort to rescue it.</p>

<p>“Go after it, I say!” And Van found himself
hurtling through the air once more. When he
came up from the cold depths, the piece of wood
was at his side, but still he did not see how it had
anything to do with him, and he swam back once
more to Thatcher.</p>

<p>Again he was thrown in, and farther than before.
This time as he made his way to shore,
he put two and two together, and made four out
of it.</p>

<p>One, it was Thatcher who had done the deed,
and he was not to be trusted; two, he did not need<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
swimming lessons; three, the water was cold and
he was tired; and four, he did not intend to give
Thatcher another chance to play so contemptible
a trick upon him. He turned suddenly and made
for the far side of the pond.</p>

<p>Swift as a bird, Betsy was there to meet him.
He shook himself, and she gathered him, all dripping,
to her bosom, and ran for the house.</p>

<p>That was all he wanted of the pond. One
more lesson he had, when Betsy was not by to
rescue him. He was thrown in again and again,
until he was a thoroughly disgusted little dog,
with a hatred for the very sight of water. From
that time on he never willingly wet his feet. He
hated even his bath and would run and hide if
any one mentioned the word to him. But he
learned that baths must be taken, no matter how
disagreeable. A Prince must be clean, if he would
live in a palace; and Betsy, in her new zeal for
soap and water, took him in charge herself, and
continued to scrub him faithfully.</p>

<p>The rest of Thatcher’s efforts at training resulted
in a series of failures. Thatcher was
willing, but Van was not. He did not intend to
be trained by his valet, and one, too, who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
betrayed him at the outset. Where confidence is
lacking one cannot get great results in dealing
with a wilful son of royalty.</p>

<p>The next instructor was more successful.</p>

<p>Dr. Peters, one of the young physicians at the
Hospital, came over one morning on an errand.
He was made acquainted with Van and duly admired
him.</p>

<p>“Have you taught him any tricks, Miss
Betsy?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t know how to teach him.”</p>

<p>“Let me try him. He looks as bright as a button.
You can teach anything to a dog like that,
if you go at it in the right way. Come here,
Van.”</p>

<p>Van came, expecting a game of romps, or, at
the very least, a pat on the head.</p>

<p>“Dead Dog!” said Dr. Peters; and Van found
himself unaccountably flat on his back, waving his
helpless paws in the air.</p>

<p>“Dead Dog!” Dr. Peters repeated,—“Dead!
Dead! Now shut your eyes,—tight!” Two
fingers closed their lids.</p>

<p>Van struggled. This was an insult to his royal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
person. But he was held there. Then, of a sudden,
at the word “Police!” he was released.</p>

<p>“Get him a piece of cake, Miss Betsy. Now
try it again, Van. Dead Dog!”</p>

<p>Van looked just an instant at Dr. Peters, as
if he were trying to understand clearly; and then,
thump! down he went, lying as still as the doorstep
itself, until he heard the word of relief.
Then he was up, jumping and capering as if he
himself had thought out the whole thing.</p>

<p>The next time Dr. Peters came over, Van saw
him from afar, and promptly plumped down, not
waiting for the command; and there he lay, prone
on the sidewalk, until the word “Police!” released
him.</p>

<p>But he never liked doing this particular trick,
and would do it for no one else without much
coaxing. It was not seemly for him to take so
humble a position, and all his life, whenever he
was told to do “Dead Dog,” he would first go
through all the other tricks he had ever been
taught, hoping that people would forget about
this disagreeable one, and pass it by.</p>

<p>All puppies, whether they are thoroughbreds
or mongrels, begin life by practising their sharp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
little teeth on something, and generally they care
little whether it be a lace curtain or a fine Bokhara
rug. From the first Van was taught that he must
be full owner of the thing he might wish to
destroy.</p>

<p>Betsy gave him one of her discarded copper-toed
shoes to try his tiny new teeth upon.</p>

<p>“Now, Vanny-Boy, this shoe is yours; no, no,—<i>this</i>
one that I give you. You mustn’t touch this
other one.”</p>

<p>Van fell to upon his gift. Bit by bit he demolished
the leather—the scraps lay all over the
floor. Down to the bare bones of it he worried
his way, and then he began on the sole. In a
day or so he had this also in shreds. Only the
heel and the bit of copper remained to tell of his
busy moments. All this time the other shoe lay
near by, but he never looked at it. When the
task he had set himself was finished, he came
wriggling to Betsy, who offered him the mate.
Then and then only did he seize the other shoe,
and it soon followed in the way of its fellow.</p>

<p>Under the little writing-desk in Betsy’s room
was an old and dilapidated carpet-covered footstool,
which showed unmistakable signs of a long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
and useful life. Van, who loved playing at Betsy’s
feet, discovered the rag-tag-and-bobtail effect of
it, and received permission to worry the poor old
thing. Little by little the carpet grew thinner,
but it held out for many days.</p>

<p>One morning Betsy went in town with Aunt
Kate, leaving Van safe in the kitchen with Mary.</p>

<p>That is, she <i>thought</i> he was safe. Van lay in
his basket under the table, until Mary went down
in the cellar. Then he arose, and went toward
the swinging door that led into the dining-room.
He had learned a secret about that door at the
time of the yellow-cat episode. He pushed it—very
gently. It yielded; a little more—it opened,
swung back again, and struck him right on the
tip of his little black nose.</p>

<p>He winked hard, and sat back a moment to
get his bearings; then he went at it again. With
his whole weight thrown against it, it swung
widely, and with a dash he was through, and on
the other side before it could close again. He
was free, with the whole house before him, and
no one to say him nay.</p>

<p>But it was not a voyage of discovery on which
he was bent. He had business on hand. A young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
and energetic dog should not be idle, and there
was work to do.</p>

<p>Up the stairs he clambered,—that was the
hardest of all, for every step must be gained with
a stretch, a reach, a hump, and a scramble. At
last his little brown head peeped over the top
landing, and the way was clear to Betsy’s room.</p>

<p>No hesitation. His duty lay before him. He
headed straight for the old footstool, sought out
the weakest spot, just where he had left off yesterday.
It was no sin; the stool was his very
own, and where is the monarch who may not, if
he likes, chew his own footstool?</p>

<p>Very quiet and busy he was, for a time. Bit
by bit that barrier of heavy carpet warp must be
worn away. He had no pick and shovel, like the
miners and sappers under a fortress; his only
weapons were his sharp little teeth, and the small
nails on his forepaws; but he went bravely to
work.</p>

<p>He chewed and he chewed; he never paused
for a minute; he never gave the enemy an instant
to recover lost ground. If he had been a soldier
in war-time, he would have been cheered on as a
hero, so manfully did he hold to his task.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>At last he got a tooth in, and could tear at the
strong linen walls. The breach grew wider—there
was room for his paw. He inserted it, and
drew out a fascinating bit of plunder; curly,
woody stuff it was.</p>

<p>A volley of dust from the defense struck him
full in the nose and made him sneeze and choke.
This opposition only made his spirits soar the
higher. Tooth and nail he struck back. He tore
down the whole barrier, and rushed in on the
defenseless excelsior.</p>

<p>The fierce frenzy of destruction—that savage
instinct that has made other princes and kings
tear down whole cities—took possession of him.
Clouds of dust rolled up from the interior, and
filled his nostrils like the smoke of battle. He
dove into the very center of the core of the inside
of the middle of the last dungeon of the fortress.
Up heaved the excelsior before his frantic onslaught,
flying in every direction. It lay in heaps,
around him, over him, under him, in front of him,
behind him. It fell on the remotest breastwork
of furniture.</p>

<p>The rout was complete! No explosion could
have rent that footstool more disastrously. Van<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
shook off the ruins that had landed on his back;
lay down on the empty shell of what was no
longer and never more would be a footstool, and
proceeded to divide the spoils, so to speak.</p>

<p>He worked through long and short division,
and was worrying through a problem in fractions
which concerned the last fragment that could still
be called carpet, when Mrs. Johns and Betsy
appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>Through a haze they dimly saw a brown and
white morsel of live joy, triumphing in the midst
of a drifting mass of excelsior. Van lifted his
head proudly and looked at them, as if he would
say,</p>

<p>“Alone I did it! Excelsior!”</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“‘I can stand it a week.’”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was a summer full
of events for both
Van and his mistress.
Slowly and patiently
Aunt Kate corrected
Betsy’s uncouth
ways, and the book of
“Manners” grew. Betsy
took smaller mouthfuls
now, used her fork
properly and ate quietly.
She learned her
tricks like Van, having
to be told but once. If
she forgot she corrected
herself.</p>

<p>Aunt Kate said one
day to Uncle Ben,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>“The child ‘eats’ everything I say to her, as
if she were greedy for it, and what’s more, she
digests it.”</p>

<p>“She’s just at the impressionable age,” said
Dr. Johns. “Look at her out on the lawn there
with the dog. When she thinks no one is looking
at her she gambols almost as gracefully as he
does.”</p>

<p>“I’m so glad she came to us. Everything seems
different. I feel as if I had a rare, strange plant
to tend, and when she grows out of that hard
little bud of shyness, she’ll be the rose of my
heart’s desire. It was a great inspiration, getting
her into pretty clothes at the very start. I really
think she is trying to live up to them.”</p>

<p>“I think it more likely that she is trying to live
up to her Aunt Kate,” Uncle Ben chivalrously
said, and as he started for the office, there was on
his face the smile that Aunt Kate loved to see—the
smile that made all the Hospital patients
love him.</p>

<p>Betsy came in with her book as soon as she
saw him go.</p>

<p>“I’m getting a lot of manners, Aunt Kate. My
book’s ’most full.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>“I am so glad, dear, and you are getting them
by heart, too. I haven’t heard you say ‘ain’t’ for
a week. By the way, how about those finger-nails?
Let me see.”</p>

<p>But instead of showing them Betsy snapped
her hands behind her.</p>

<p>“Let me look, dear. Haven’t you remembered?”</p>

<p>“No—no’m—not much. I try, but they just
chew theirselves when I’m not thinking. They
aren’t fitten to see.”</p>

<p>Aunt Kate took the two little hands in her own
delicate ones. They lay palms up, showing a row
of callous spots at the base of the fingers.</p>

<p>For a moment dear Aunt Kate looked; then
she softly stooped and kissed them. The child
stood wide-eyed, wondering.</p>

<p>“What’d you do that for? They aren’t
pretty.”</p>

<p>“Because every one of those spots means that
a little girl has helped her mother, and I love
them. I almost wish that I could have some myself
for so fine a reason.”</p>

<p>She turned the hands over.</p>

<p>“But these—these—oh, my little Betsy! To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
trim such good hands in such a sorry way. Nails
are intended to be the ornaments of a hand, quite
as much, and more, than rings are. Every nail
should have a crescent moon at its base, and another
little pearl moon-rise at the tip. There
should be no ragged edges or hang-nails. I’ve
told you so many times. Now I shall have to
do something to make you remember.</p>

<p>“Remember, too, dear, that I do this because
I love you, and I want you to be sweet in every
way.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Johns went to her desk, and returned
with a bottle of India ink and a small brush.</p>

<p>“Now, Betsy, as long as the edges of your nails
are rough and black, the middle might as well be
black, too.”</p>

<p>Quickly Aunt Kate put a drop of ink in the
center of each nail. Betsy held her breath with
the surprise of it.</p>

<p>“Hold them out like that till they’re dry. If
the spots come off when you wash your hands,
I’ll put on more. When you see them you will
think not to bite your nails, and you must keep
them on for a week. By that time your nails<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
will grow out, and then I’ll show you how to
take proper care of them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Aunt Kate, please! Must I wear them
like that to the table—right before Uncle Ben?
What will he say?”</p>

<p>“Uncle Ben will think as I do, that the black
spots look no worse than the close-bitten edges.”</p>

<p>Tears came in Betsy’s eyes. It was not like
Aunt Kate to punish. For a moment she stood
with quivering lips, looking down at the queer,
ink-spotted finger-tips. Then she straightened up.</p>

<p>“I can stand it a week. You can stand anything
you <i>got</i> to stand. I guess this’ll be a warnin’
to me.”</p>

<p>Not another whisper of rebellion came from
her lips. She wore her badges of disgrace manfully,
hiding her hands, if she could, when any
one came near her. Uncle Ben looked at them,
then at Mrs. Johns, but never a word did he say,
and Betsy to this day does not know what he
thought about them.</p>

<p>Aunt Kate replaced the spots as they came off,
and the week dragged by.</p>

<p>Then, one morning, Aunt Kate came into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
Betsy’s room, and instead of the bottle of ink,
she carried a dainty little box.</p>

<p>“See here, Betsy.”</p>

<p>Betsy looked, and saw, under the satin-lined
lid, a tiny pair of curved scissors, a nail file, a
buffer with a silver handle, a box of rosy ointment—all
the things that go to make up a manicure
set.</p>

<p>“Now, let me see the nails again, Betsy dear.
Have you remembered all the time?”</p>

<p>“I forgot twice, Aunt Kate, but I got black
on my lips, so I had to remember.”</p>

<p>“Why, they’ve grown out beautifully! Good!”</p>

<p>With a bowl of warm, soapy water and a towel,
the fingers were soaked, cleaned and dried.
Deftly Aunt Kate cut each tip to a white “moon-rise,”
and with an orange stick she found the beginnings
of the crescent at the base. When the
nails had been polished Betsy did not know them
for her own.</p>

<p>“There! They look like rose petals. And
now you can do it for yourself next time. This
case is for you.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Kate!”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“I’m awful much obliged, and—and—I like
you a lot. And—may I do Van’s nails for him,
too?”</p>

<p>“Why, if you want to. But his paws have to
be on the ground, and he never bites his nails.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m never going to bite mine any more.
Van chews other things, though, Aunt Kate, and—and—may
we have another ball, please? He’s
chewed that little rubber one all up.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what we’ll do, Betsy. We’ll try
him with a rope-end. I found just the thing in
the store-room this morning. Here it is, and I’ll
tie a knot at each end. See how he likes that. A
rubber ball every day is rather expensive.”</p>

<p>The rope proved highly successful, and Betsy
and Van at either end made a great team. Betsy
jerked and pulled and Van growled and shook.
Then Van got the rope and flew all over the
house and the lawn, and when Betsy finally caught
her end there was a terrific growling and barking.
Van liked it so much that he soon got in the way
of trailing his rope on all occasions, hunting for
some one who could be coaxed to play with him.
Even a neighbor’s dog was invited to take part in
the game; but, although he wagged his tail pleasantly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
he showed no intelligence, and Van gave
him up in disgust.</p>

<p>There was another beautiful game, even better
than Rope, because the whole family could play
it of an evening, and Van was never happier than
when he could stir up everything and everybody
on the place. This was “Hide-and-Seek.” Mrs.
Johns or the Doctor would hold Van tightly, his
little body quivering with excitement, while Betsy
hid in some corner, behind a curtain or screen.
Then she would call,</p>

<p>“Coop!”</p>

<p>At the sound Van would be released, and would
dart like an arrow in the direction of Betsy’s
voice. It never took him long to find her, for his
little nose was even keener than his eyes and ears.</p>

<p>With a joyful bark he would pounce on her and
drag her back by her skirts, growling as if he
had caught a lion. Then somebody else must hide
and be found.</p>

<p>Once, when Van and Betsy had strayed as far
as the park gates, an old hen loomed up in their
path. She was bigger than Van, but a puppy
who could tree a cat could surely get some sport
out of a large bird like that. After her went Van,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
and Mrs. Dorking took to her awkward legs.
These, not filling entirely the necessity for speed,
she added wing-power to the effort. Squawking,
and frightened almost out of her feathers, she
skimmed the ground, with Van close at her heels—if
hens have heels.</p>

<p>Betsy laughed heartily at the funny sight, and
that was a grave mistake, as later events proved.
Of course Mrs. Dorking got away with all her
feathers, so Van gave up the chase, and came
back panting and wildly enthusiastic.</p>

<p>Van’s education did not consist of tricks and
games alone. No, indeed! Fox terriers have a
special use in the world; they are, above all
things, a breed of rat-catchers, and Van was a
sportsman, to the tips of his brown ears.</p>

<p>One morning he clambered out of his basket
in the kitchen just in time to see a small, gray,
furry thing dodge behind the basket and into the
pantry. He did not stop to question; every instinct
in him told him that this was Game. Like
a flash he was after it. Mary was mixing pancakes
at the far end of the pantry, and it went
right under her feet. She jumped and screamed
and nearly landed on Van’s toes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“It’s a mouse! It’s a mouse! Quick, Van!
There it goes!”</p>

<p>The door of the closet where the pots and pans
were kept stood ajar. In went the mouse; in
went Van. The mouse went under a skillet, Van
turned it over and jumped after; he chased it
around a vinegar jug; he knocked over a pile of
pans, and they fell with a terrible clatter; the
mouse crept under one, and Van rooted up the
whole of them, and sent them flying galley-west,
while Mary took turns screaming and laughing.</p>

<p>Van hunted the mouse through the pantry, out
into the kitchen again, and behind a broom in the
corner. Bang! That was the broom falling.
Pounce! That was Van, and Mrs. Mouse was
no more.</p>

<p>By this time the whole Johns family was on
the spot. They could not, unless they had been
stone deaf, have escaped hearing the racket. Van
was in his element. Not only had he brought
down his first game, but he had an admiring audience,
which he loved of all things. He swaggered
around and tossed the mouse into the air, as if
by so doing he could make them all understand
just what a grand, brave dog he was. Lastly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
he came proudly to lay his prize at the feet of his
beloved mistress.</p>

<p>And Betsy spoiled his fun by taking the mouse
away from him. It was all right for Van to kill
a mouse, she argued, because mice are harmful,
but one should not gloat over it. Van did not
see things that way. He gave one grieved look
at the unfeeling Betsy, jumped into his basket and
sulked.</p>

<p>Then Betsy added insult to injury by pulling
him out of the basket and carrying him upstairs.
Aunt Kate, passing by, saw the child on the window
seat. Very busy Betsy was with something,
and that something was Van, who was wriggling
tremendously.</p>

<p>“See here just a minute, Aunt Kate. Ai—aren’t
they nice?”</p>

<p>She exhibited Van’s paws, with every nail
scraped clean and white.</p>

<p>“He didn’t like it a mite, but he knew it had
to be did, or he couldn’t be a gentleman. I
washed ’em with a nail brush to get the mouse
off.”</p>

<p>The catching of the mouse was the clinching
nail in Dr. Johns’ respect for Van. He looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
upon him now as a good and useful dog, and no
longer as a mere plaything.</p>

<p>As for Betsy, that evening, beside her napkin
at the dinner table, there lay a tiny white box,
and in it shone a gold circlet set with a tiny diamond.
Uncle Ben’s card lay on top, with the
words</p>

<p>“For the hand with the little pink nails.”</p>

<small>VAN GOES TO CHURCH</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MR. JOHNS went over and closed the door
carefully, when Betsy had been excused
after lunch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>“By the way, Kate, I received a letter this
morning from that father of hers.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the poor baby! He isn’t going to bother
her, is he?”</p>

<p>“Read it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Johns took the soiled bit of paper and
read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dr. Johns, Sir, I bin told you have taken my
Betsy and are a-bringing of her up. I am expecting
a good job up-State, and if I git it I can
take her off your hands. I need her to help my
new woman keep house for me who aint very
strong, but she can train Betsy all right. You
can just put her on the train at New York, and
she can come strait here without no change, and
she wont be no more expense to you,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Yours truly,</span><br>
Alvin Wixon.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Oh, Ben!” gasped Mrs. Johns. “You won’t
let him?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. He’s a low, drunken scoundrel,
and his first wife starved to death. He can
easily be proved unfit as a guardian; no court
would sustain any claim of his, and I can be appointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
Betsy’s legal guardian. She’s a bright,
capable child, and it would be a pity to have such
good material wasted washing dishes for a stepmother,
who probably would not be any kinder to
her than her father has been.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ben, we mustn’t let it happen! Why, I
couldn’t let her go now. She’s like my own, and
growing dearer every day. Have you answered
the letter?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I told him the facts of the case. I think
he will make no further trouble.”</p>

<p>“I hope not. Dear, dear! I wish the child
would show more affection for me. Perhaps it is
just timidity, but she looks like a startled fawn
when I kiss her. The only thing so far that
seems to reach her is Van.”</p>

<p>“Don’t hurry her. It’ll come. She can’t help
loving you, Kate. Nobody could. But she’s not
accustomed to the shows of love. Van is a dog.
He simply forces himself on her. If she doesn’t
cuddle him, he cuddles her. He’s the most taking
bit I ever saw on four legs.”</p>

<p>“If he can only break down that uncanny coldness!
If she would only be a child instead of a
little old woman, I could get at her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>“Wait,” replied Dr. Johns. “At this stage Van
is the educating principle in matters of the heart.
You are doing well in other ways. By the way,
she ought to know other children.”</p>

<p>“There are none on the Hill-Top of the kind I
want her to know now. I’m trying to improve
her English, and for a little while I want her to
hear only the best. When school opens, that will
help. I’ll tell you,—I might send her in town to
Sunday School. She’ll hear correct English there,
and see children who have nice manners.”</p>

<p>So Betsy started to Sunday School. She wore
her prettiest clothes and walked stiffly, as if trying
to do her duty by the dainty garments. She was
introduced to a teacher, and for a few Sundays
Aunt Kate asked no questions, waiting for developments.
Betsy went dutifully, but made no
sign.</p>

<p>At last Aunt Kate said,</p>

<p>“Do you like your Sunday School, Betsy?”</p>

<p>“Good enough. The folks there think that
God punishes you for your sins. I know better.
I’ve been awful bad sometimes and He hasn’t
punished me a mite.”</p>

<p>“I think we are punished when we break God’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
laws. Sometimes we are punished by seeing the
ones we love suffer.”</p>

<p>Betsy thought a moment.</p>

<p>“Maybe so,” she said at last. “When I’ve
been bad, Ma was sorry, and that made me
sorry.”</p>

<p>“I think, little Betsy,” said Aunt Kate, slowly,
“that when we are born we have in us the seeds
of either good or bad, and it is the seeds we care
for and train as we grow up, that make us good
or evil. How are you getting on with the girls
in the class?”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right, I guess. I don’t get acquainted
much. They’re sort of—different, or else—<i>I’m</i>
queer. But I’m watchin’ ’em, Aunt Kate, like I
do you at the table, and I don’t feel so different
as I did at first.”</p>

<p>“Good! Everything will come out right after
a while, when the girls know my Betsy as well
as I do.”</p>

<p>Betsy did not answer, but there was a soft little
light in her eyes.</p>

<p>She continued her attendance, and Van, who
had watched her weekly disappearance, dressed
in her Sunday best, determined to make a closer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
investigation of affairs. There must be some special
charm about these daytime excursions from
which he was excluded.</p>

<p>One fine Sabbath morning he was on the lawn,
sunning himself, when he saw Betsy come out
of the house, book in hand, best hat on, and start
down the hill toward town. Van dropped in happily
behind her.</p>

<p>“Go back, Van!” said Betsy.</p>

<p>Van tossed his royal head and ran on, pretending
that he was bent on his own affairs.</p>

<p>“I’ll get rid of him when I get on the car,”
thought Betsy.</p>

<p>She climbed on at the trolley-station, and did
not see the little brown and white streak dashing
madly along behind, clear into the town. There
were many stops for the church-goers, so Van
was able to keep the car in sight. It stopped in
front of the church just as the Sunday School bell
was ringing, and all the good little Episcopalian
children were walking sedately in at the door,
dressed in their prettiest and cleanest Sunday-go-to-meeting
frocks and coats. As Betsy mounted
the steps she was greeted by a member of her
class.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>Just then Van ambled up, with his tongue out,
and his eye lighted with the excitement of adventure.</p>

<p>“There’s your dog, Betsy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my goodness! I thought I got away from
him. Go home, Van! Go straight home, I tell
you—this minute!”</p>

<p>Van dropped his head, lowered his tail slightly,
and turned his back dutifully, looking sideways
to see if Betsy were keeping an eye upon him.
But she had disappeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>Van went a few steps toward home, then
stopped to consider. Betsy being out of sight, at
the very least he might take a look around and
see what a church was like.</p>

<p>He turned and went back to the stone steps,
climbed them slowly, and went inside the open
vestibule.</p>

<p>“Get out!” said the sexton to Van, not knowing
that he was addressing royalty.</p>

<p>Van got out, and the sexton went into the big
empty part of the church, to see that everything
was ready for the evening meeting.</p>

<p>Once more Van entered the vestibule. One of
the teachers came out of the Sunday School room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
for a minute, and then returned. He did not
bother to look at Van.</p>

<p>But Van saw something. That door swung
both ways, and had no latch—like the door between
the pantry and dining-room at home. This
was luck indeed. Van knew how to work that
kind of door. You listen a moment to make sure
that no one is coming from the other side to
bang into your nose; next you stand on your
hind legs and throw your whole weight on the
door; then, when it swings open, you make a
quick dash through the crack before it can come
back at you and squeeze your tail—and there you
are!</p>

<p>Van tried it. It worked! No one saw him.
There was a man on a platform, but his eyes were
shut and his head was bowed. All the little Episcopalian
children were kneeling, and their heads,
too, were bowed; the teachers were doing the same
thing. Van did not know what it meant, but he
walked calmly up the aisle.</p>

<p>A familiar white hat was bobbing at the end
of one of the seats. Van saw it and made his way
in that direction. Just as the prayer ended with
a resounding “Amen!” Van plumped himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
down contentedly at Betsy’s feet, and looked innocently
upward.</p>

<p>“Van!” she whispered. “Van, you bad dog,
what are you doing here? I told you to go home.”</p>

<p>Van put his nose on the floor between his forepaws,
and sighed peacefully, as if he had not
heard her. Unless force were used, he intended
to stay and see the performance through.</p>

<p>Betsy’s heart was filled with misgivings; but
rather than run the gauntlet of the whole school’s
eyes, with a dog under her arm, she decided to
hold him until the service was over. The teacher
had not noticed; her eyes were on the heads and
not the feet of the children.</p>

<p>Betsy tucked Van under the seat, where he lay
until the lesson was over—as good a dog as ever
lived, and far better than some of the children,
who found it hard to keep their minds on holy
things, with a small brown head and two bright
eyes popping out every time a question from the
catechism brought forth a childish answer.</p>

<p>Once more the superintendent lifted his voice
in prayer, and Van crept softly out from under
the seat to see if he could find out what it really
meant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>Now the hymn was given out, the pianist took
his seat, and began to run over the tune. This
was fine! Van liked music and he pricked up his
ears. Behind Betsy’s back he jumped up on the
seat, and began to roll his eyes and cock his head
to one side as if to take in the full beauty of the
notes.</p>

<p>A small boy began to giggle, and the children
all over the room craned their heads over the
backs of the seats; some even climbed up to peer
over, and the whisper went around,</p>

<p>“There’s a dog in Sunday School!”</p>

<p>Betsy tried to repress him without being noticed.
But there was a decided tide of attention
setting her way. The teacher began to take notice,
too.</p>

<p>Betsy’s face was crimson. She could not
carry Van out, just as they were beginning to
sing. She put down her hand and whispered out
of the corner of her mouth,</p>

<p>“Behave yourself, Van!”</p>

<p>Now the unlucky star of a certain small boy
decreed that on this particular Sunday he should
be asked to display his accomplishments by accompanying
the children with his violin, on which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
he had been taking lessons for nearly four
months. A proud father and mother had urged
him on, and there he stood beside the pianist, with
his bow raised.</p>

<p>Down it came on the strings in the first strains
of “From Greenland’s Icy Mountains,” the voices
of all the school joining in, in fine, childish harmony.</p>

<p>At the first wail of the instrument Van leaped
to a point of vantage on the seat. He did not
wait for a hymn-book; he simply lifted up his
voice and joined the chorus in a song without
words—a long-drawn, mournful howl! He could
sing that hymn with the best of them; he would
show them!</p>

<p>“Stop, Van!” Betsy tried to shut him off by
putting her hand over his mouth, but he wriggled
free, barked an evil defiance, and continued his
heartrending strains. Who was she that she
should interfere with the religious devotions of
the son of kings, a hero, and a singer of songs?
The teachers tried their best to look shocked,
and the superintendent openly grinned.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_084_facing">
  <img alt="She fled with him down the aisle" class="w100" src="images/i_084_facing.jpg" id="id-6779091035505507835">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><span class="smcap">She fled with him down the aisle</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Betsy no longer shunned publicity. She was
flooded with it anyway. Seizing the singer she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>fled with him down the aisle, leaving the room
swept by a gale of laughter that might have been
heard almost to India’s coral strand! It was a
shocking end to a devotional exercise.</p>

<p>Betsy did not go back; she took Van out in
the vestibule and spanked him. She haled him
home; she told him that he was a young imp; and
that if ever he followed her to Sunday School
again she would know why.</p>

<p>After this Van decided to try another service.
Mary the cook loved him too, and Mary was a
good Catholic. Perhaps he was too old and too
musically-inclined for Sunday School. The next
Sunday he followed Mary as she started to Mass.</p>

<p>“Look out, Mary!” called Treesa, “Van’s following
you.”</p>

<p>“Ah, sure now the Boy-Heart can go down the
hill wit’ me. I’ll hunt him home before I goes in.”</p>

<p>At the door of Mary’s church she “hunted him
home,” and he turned as if to go, but the minute
her back was turned he was behind her, and behind
her he marched up the steps and up the aisle.
In Mary’s pew he took his station, and at Mary’s
feet he lay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>Father O’Givney came down from his pulpit
after Mass, and Mary apologized.</p>

<p>“The Boy-O folleyed me, Father O’Givney, an’
I hunted him home, but right back he came. He
sure do be liking it here, an’ a foine church it
is, to be sure. He’s the great Boy—that.”</p>

<p>“I’ve a dog of my own at home,” said Father
O’Givney. He was Irish, too, and Mary’s soft
brogue was to him like the music of the Ould Sod.
“Van’s behaving well, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Sure, he’s always the gentleman!” answered
Mary, and Van was left, unrebuked and undisturbed.</p>

<p>No one will ever know how many times Van
went to Mass with Mary. She kept her own
counsel. But I have my suspicions that to-day
Van is a full-fledged Roman Catholic, in good and
regular standing; and I am sure that, if it were
orthodox to admit dogs into the fold, Mary
would, long ago, have had his name entered on
the books.</p>

</figure>

<p class="drop-cap2">LIFE on the
Hill-Top
moved serenely,
and Van
grew like a
weed. His
church-going
did not
make a saint
of him,
but ever,
he grew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
dearer to the heart of Betsy. I suspect, even,
that the occasional wrongdoings of the aristocratic
little scapegrace only endeared him the
more. His sins were all sins of a high-strung,
spirited disposition, and he was so human in his
fallings from grace and his funny repentances,
that Mrs. Johns would look at him, laugh, and
exclaim,</p>

<p>“You may say what you like. He certainly
<i>looks</i> like a <i>dog</i>; but he isn’t. He’s ‘folks.’”</p>

<p>One day a man who worked on the Hospital
grounds came to the kitchen door and said excitedly
to Mary,</p>

<p>“Is Van in the house?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m thinkin’ he’s out. Is anything wrong?”</p>

<p>“There’s a mad dog loose. He’s just bitten
Joe Wood’s collie, and has gone away down town.
They’re after him with guns.”</p>

<p>“The saints preserve us! I hope the darlint
isn’t in the way of him!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I haven’t seen him, but you’d
better look after him, wherever he is.” And the
man hurried off.</p>

<p>Mary dropped her work and ran out to the
road. There, trotting calmly home in an opposite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
direction from that which the mad dog had
taken, came Van, quite unconscious of any trouble
that might be brewing for him.</p>

<p>“Heaven be praised for savin’ him!” said
Mary. “Come in, ye little spalpeen. My heart
do be beatin’ that hard I can’t get me breath.”</p>

<p>She ran to tell the family what had happened
and just then the man came back to report that
the mad dog had been killed, after biting two
or three other dogs.</p>

<p>Well, it was much to be thankful for that Van
was safe, but when Betsy came back from a trip
to town, she learned that an order had been issued
from the powers that be, and all dogs, for
the remainder of the summer, must be either
chained or muzzled.</p>

<p>“Muzzled he shall not be,” said Mrs. Johns.
“If a mad dog came along, much good would a
muzzle do! The chain is better. Poor Van, it’s
a burning shame, just as you were getting to be
almost an angel, and now it’s confinement for you
until the first of September.”</p>

<p>So Van’s liberty was taken away from him,
and, to make it harder, his beloved Betsy fell ill.
An attack of tonsilitis it was, and Van must not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
be allowed to disturb her. Thus, even in the
house there was no liberty. Betsy’s door was
shut, and the lonesome little prisoner might not
have her comforting. Mary was good to him in
the kitchen, but at every opportunity he would
slip away upstairs and paw at Betsy’s door.
There was no way to separate him from his beloved
mistress, except to keep him outside the
house. So all day long he ran sadly up and
down, with his chain attached to a long wire that
stretched from the apple tree to the honeysuckle
porch. At night there was a warm bed made for
him on a lounge in the shelter of the porch, and
he could lie there, too, in the daytime, if he chose.
But always there was the hated chain.</p>

<p>During the days of his imprisonment, Thatcher
made it his pleasure to come for him, and take
him for long walks in the woods, and these
were his only really happy times. In the woods
there were no mad dogs. So the chain would be
loosened, and Van would enjoy a wild hour of
liberty.</p>

<p>The days passed, and at last came one when
Dr. Johns said that Betsy was better, and might
sit up in bed for a little while. That day Van,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
after eating his dinner in the kitchen, went slyly
up the back stairs, and put his paw on the door
of the forbidden room. And lo! it opened to
him, and there sat his mistress, propped among
her pillows.</p>

<p>“Vanny-Boy! Dear Vanny-Boy!” cried she,
and he flew on the wings of love, leaped upon the
bed, and cried and moaned and kissed her ear as
if she had been long away. Betsy snuggled him
down by her side, and he went to sleep with his
nose on her knee.</p>

<p>Mrs. Johns, coming in later, found him there.</p>

<p>“Please let him stay, Aunt Kate. I’ve missed
him so, and I’m almost well now.”</p>

<p>So, after that, every afternoon, when he came
in from his walk, he spent a happy hour with his
dear mistress.</p>

<p>One night, after a hot and breathless day, Dr.
and Mrs. Johns were sitting with Betsy in her
little room. The lights were out to make it
cooler, and the windows were open to the west.
A puff of wind stirred the curtains and died away
again. Dr. Johns walked to the window and
looked out.</p>

<p>“We shall have a storm to-night,” said he.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
“There’s a bank of clouds brewing something
over there in the northwest.”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll have a look around,” said Mrs.
Johns, “and see that everything is safe, in case of
a rain or blow.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t we bring Van in the house, Uncle
Ben?”</p>

<p>“I think he’s quite safe where he is. There’s
a matting screen to keep off the wind and rain
at the open end, and nothing can get through
that mass of honeysuckle along the front. He’s
better off where he is. Now, don’t worry, just
go to sleep. It is bedtime, and everything will
be fixed shipshape.”</p>

<p>Betsy sighed and said nothing more. Mrs.
Johns saw that the little Prince was safe under
his blanket on the couch and all cosy for the
night, and she did not notice the pleading in his
sad eyes as she gave him a final pat and left him
alone.</p>

<p>Every one was quiet for the night, except Betsy,
who lay tossing restlessly on her bed in the dark.</p>

<p>Outside, far off in the northwest, a strange
whisper in the air grew to a mutter and a rumble.
Betsy wrapped herself in a blanket and slipped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
in among the pillows of her window-seat, to watch
the coming storm, and she wished that she had
Van there for company; he liked a thunder-storm
as well as she herself did.</p>

<p>Betsy looked out over the hills where she had
so often watched the wonderful changes of the
sunsets. In the south there was a thin crescent
moon that showed its face by flashes between the
scurrying advance-clouds, with which the little
winds were having a grand pillow-fight. The
moon rode serenely higher and higher and paid
no attention to the play that was going on.</p>

<p>But after a time the game grew fast and furious,
and the moon went quite out of sight, as
bigger winds joined in with bigger and bigger
pillows—not downy white ones, but gray puffs,
like rolls of smoke.</p>

<p>Low in the northwest a sullen mass of black
lifted itself slowly, and one could see the head
of old Father Wind rising out of his blankets.
Taller and taller he grew, his long hair sweeping
away in coils and spirals, that whipped uncannily
off his head only to let other locks grow in their
places. A giant he grew, with a bag on his back,
and his blankets rolling up around him, dark and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
awful. He would give those Little Winds, who
had waked him up, something to blow about.</p>

<p>Up and up he rose, leaving behind him a weird
yellow counterpane stretched out along the line
of hills. Lightnings flashed from his eyes, and
his voice boomed like great guns.</p>

<p>The Little Winds and the Bigger Winds
gave up their game, and scuttled off before the
growing fury, as old Father Wind pulled handfuls
of <i>real</i> wind out of his bag and threw them
about. Soon his blankets, gray and ragged, unfolded
and rushed up the sky, and the Little
Winds disappeared altogether.</p>

<p>Then Father Wind had it all his own way, and
he worked himself into a towering rage. Snake-like
flashes of flame dripped from his finger-tips,
darting back and forth till the whole sky was
lighted up like a great furnace. Up rolled the
blankets, one after the other, until one could see
only a whirling, tumbling mass. On, on! The
far hill-line was blotted out, and the sleeping
town was drowned in a boiling, seething chaos of
cloud, wind, and falling water.</p>

<p>Up the hill rushed Father Wind, now a vast,
formless destroyer. He reached out his long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
arms, blew a great breath, and the first blast
struck the hilltop where stood the solid buildings
of the Hospital.</p>

<p>Rip-boom-bang! The house shook to its very
foundations. Could it stand that awful onslaught?
Betsy saw a great tree on the lawn
snap like a twig, and with some fibers still clinging
to the trunk, stretch its arms helplessly along
the path of the wind. Leaves by thousands
twisted off and flew like fear-driven goblins. A
board from no-one-knew-where came up the hillside
and struck the honeysuckle porch, tearing the
vines till they floated out like green ribbons.</p>

<p>Every one in the house was awake now, rushing
around to see if the doors and windows were
safe.</p>

<p>Mrs. Johns came into Betsy’s room.</p>

<p>“Are you all right, dearie?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Aunt Kate; did you bring Vanny-Boy in?”</p>

<p>“No, dear, we did not waken in time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Aunt Kate! He’s out there now?”</p>

<p>“We dare not open the door, Betsy. This is
a terrible storm. I do not know what would happen
if the wind should find an entrance.”</p>

<p>“We must get him—he will be killed!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“We cannot, dear. It is not possible. He may
not get hurt at all; and then any one might be
killed who tried to go after him when things are
flying as they are now. We must wait for a lull
in the storm.”</p>

<p>Betsy said no more, but waited till Mrs. Johns
went on further errands. Then, clinging to the
walls and balusters, she stole down the stairs, and
looked through the window that opened on the
honeysuckle porch. It was a scene of battle; the
matting screen, torn in shreds, appeared glued to
the ceiling; as she looked, the last rocking-chair
went careening away into the yard, where the
wreckage of the other furniture already lay. Pillows
and blankets were clinging to tree-trunks or
plastered to sodden flower-beds, and poor Van
was standing on the mattress, watching with big,
frightened eyes as things went by.</p>

<p>Rip! went a shutter over his head, and trembling
he crept up on the sill whose angle offered
a bit of shelter.</p>

<p>Just in time! The next gust took the mattress
with it, leaving only the bare iron bones of the
cot, to which Van’s chain was fastened.</p>

<p>“If the wind should blow him off, his little neck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
would be broken. I <i>must</i> do something,” thought
Betsy.</p>

<p>Now the rain came down in blinding sheets.
Betsy could stand it no longer.</p>

<p>“Vanny-Boy, I’m going to get you, no matter
what happens.” It was easy enough to open the
door, the waiting wind was only too eager. It
took but an instant, but in that instant Betsy was
soaked to the skin. Without heeding that, nor
the roaring of the wind as it burst into the hallway,
she stepped out into the awful tumult,
slipped the catch of Van’s chain, picked up the
half-drowned, frightened little body, and set him
inside the door.</p>

<p>Then came the really hard part—to shut the
door again. Betsy pushed with all her might. A
strong man could hardly have done it, and she
was just recovering from an illness. In the hallway
pictures were torn from their moorings, and
the furniture was dancing a quickstep. Try as
best she might, with all her strength, she could
not close the latch.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to do it,” she sobbed, “I’ve just <i>got</i>
to, that’s all there is to it!”</p>

<p>When a thing <i>must</i> be done, somehow one seems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
to have a little more than human power. Betsy
gave one more desperate push, and click! went
the latch. She and Vanny-Boy were safe!</p>

<p>Now she turned to climb the stair, but instead
she gave a weak little laugh, her legs crumpled
under her like paper, and she went down in a
wavering heap on the floor, with puddles of water
running from her in every direction. Van stood
over her, whining.</p>

<p>“Go call them, Van! <i>Get your rope!</i>”</p>

<p>He knew what that meant; oh, yes! Up the
stairs he leaped, barking, as if rope was what all
this fuss was about, anyhow.</p>

<p>“Why, there’s Van! How did he get in?”
said Dr. Johns. A suspicion came to him, and
he hurried down the stairs, where he found Betsy,
dripping and helpless, but laughing.</p>

<p>“My dear, you should not have done this!
Terrible things might have happened.”</p>

<p>“I just <i>had</i> to do it, Uncle Ben. He’d prob’ly
have been killed if I hadn’t.”</p>

<p>“And you might have been killed, you gallant
little rescuer.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s done now, and I’m glad I did it,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
said Betsy, as she was carried upstairs, put in
dry clothing and sent back to bed.</p>

<p>In the morning the adventurers turned out to
be none the worse for their soaking. But oh, the
wreck of the honeysuckle porch, and the flower-beds,
and the noble trees whose heads had been
lopped off! Nature had to work hard, with considerable
help from the florist and the carpenter,
to get things back into shapeliness. The honeysuckle
porch had its broken vines trimmed off, the
soaked pillows were dried out, and the place generally
was restored to order. But Van slept there
no more. His Betsy was better, and the freedom
of the house was his again. September came,
and with it the glad freedom of out-of-doors, and
his old careless happy life.</p>

<small>MORE LESSONS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“BETSY,” said Mrs. Johns, “school begins
next Monday. Would you like to go?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my, yes, Aunt Kate. May I?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. I haven’t bothered you much this
summer about your studies, for there were so
many other important things to learn. But I
think you had better begin now.”</p>

<p>“Do you think I have enough manners, Aunt
Kate?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>“Why, dearie, you’ve done wonders in these
three months, and I’m going to send you to Pelham
Towers as a day pupil. You’ll meet little
girls there with good manners and it will help you.
How are you in your studies? Do you like
books?”</p>

<p>“I just love ’em, Aunt Kate, and I took two
prizes last winter term. Then Pa wouldn’t let
me go any more. He said if I could take prizes
I knew enough. I felt awful, at first. But I
guess Ma did need me. She was took—taken—sick
pretty soon, and she never did get well any
more.”</p>

<p>“Betsy dear, I’m sure it was best for you to
help your mother, and what you did will help
make you the fine woman you are going to be
some day. But there’s nothing now to hinder
you from learning as fast as you like.”</p>

<p>So Betsy began, and after the first day she came
home looking very thoughtful.</p>

<p>“Well, how does school seem to you? What’s
on your mind, Betsy?”</p>

<p>“It’s all right, I guess,” she said slowly. “But—Aunt
Kate, it’s like it is at Sunday School. My
clothes are as nice and nicer than most, but—I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
heard one girl tell another one—they thought I
wasn’t hearin’—that I was ‘country’.”</p>

<p>“Never mind them, Betsy. How about your
lessons?”</p>

<p>“Well, Auntie, I was all kinds. Grammar,—”
Betsy smiled up sidewise at her Aunt,—“grammar,—I’m
not much; geography,—I’m in the
top class; ’rithmetic,—I’m top in that, too; reading,—Miss
Pelham says I have a good voice, but
I need a lot of trainin’; and nature study,—Aunt
Kate, I don’t know the names of things, but I
know more about bugs and worms and garden
sass and wild flowers than the whole school. And
oh, Aunt Kate, I’m going to learn the name of
everything there is on earth.”</p>

<p>“Good girl! That’s the right road to travel.”</p>

<p>“And, Auntie Kate,” Betsy’s eyes were on the
floor now, “I’m going to watch those girls, and
the first thing you know I won’t be queer any
more. I’ll be a real lady.”</p>

<p>“You’ve the makings of one in you, Betsy girl.
Don’t be in a hurry, everything will come out
finely. I’ll trust you.”</p>

<p>“Some of those girls have got too many manners.
They’re silly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“Follow after the simpler-mannered ones; putting
on airs is not good manners. How is your
book coming on? I have never seen what you
have written. Don’t you think I am entitled to
just a glimpse?”</p>

<p>Without a word Betsy got the book and handed
it to Mrs. Johns, who opened it with a keen appreciation
of the sacredness of it, and of the little
girl’s simple trust in her.</p>

<p>From beginning to end it was a record of struggle
and victory. Aunt Kate did not smile, although
many of the items were quaint, to say the
least. The first one was:</p>

<p>“Bathe yurself good. Do not skip neck and
ears.”</p>

<p>Following came such as these:</p>

<p>“Bread is not buttered all to once. You break
off little chunks.”</p>

<p>“A mouthful is not what you can stuf in. It is
very little.”</p>

<p>“Do not bite your nales.”</p>

<p>“Hold your spoon and fork in your fingers like
they was hot and burnin’ you.”</p>

<p>“Do not skuf your feet.”</p>

<p>“Do not drink out loud. Van makes a noise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
but he is a dog and diffrent. Eat as still as you
know how.”</p>

<p>“Knives is to cut with and nothin’ else.”</p>

<p>“Do not dip your supe tords you. It may go
in your lap.”</p>

<p>“Drink supe from the side of spoon. (This is
orkard, but Aunt Kate says it is currect.) Do not
soke cracker in supe.”</p>

<p>“A lie is the worst thing on earth. I will never
be a liar.”</p>

<p>“Never bite your nales.”</p>

<p>“I will kepe my sole clene, just like the rest of
me.”</p>

<p>“Teeth will not spoil on you if you brush ’em
every time you eat.”</p>

<p>“Hare is a woman’s glory if it is comed. If
not it is a site.”</p>

<p>“Aint and haint is not nice. Same with yep
and nope.”</p>

<p>“Slang and swear words is not nice.”</p>

<p>“Never never never bite your nales. Ladies
hands is always clene.”</p>

<p>There were many others, all showing that the
child was struggling hard to reach her physical
and moral ideals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>“Betsy mine, I’m astonished at the amount of
things you have learned; and the best of it is that
you are using your knowledge. Why, I’m proud
of you.”</p>

<p>And now the long days of romping with Van
were over. Betsy took her lunch, and did not
reach home until half-past three. Always the little
Prince was on the lookout for her return. He
knew when the very minute came for her to turn
in at the park gates, and would bark frantically
until he was let out. Then a wild rush, and before
she was past the lodge-gate, he would be leaping
upon her. A frolic and a ramble would follow,
and after that Betsy must study a little before
dinner.</p>

<p>With the flying days one had only to look at
Betsy to see her grow. She held her own at
school, for her independent way of holding
herself aloof kept her from exposing her
speech and actions to criticism. Gradually she
assimilated the gentle breeding of the better
class of girls in the school. There was a fine
instinct in her that kept her ideals in the right
path. In her classes, although at first her expressions
were not always couched in elegance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
her understanding of things was clear. She
loved her books to their very bindings. To
get at them she would almost neglect her play
with Van. Her standing in her classes gradually
caused the girls to respect her, but although her
little heart craved a closer intimacy with some of
them, she could not bring herself to break the
bond of reserve which her loveless childhood had
woven about her. So, while her comrades came
to her for help in their lessons, they went off with
their arms twined about each other, leaving her
wondering. With Aunt Kate she would talk eagerly
and intelligently, but at the touch of a caressing
arm, there would come in Betsy’s eyes
that startled glance of the wild thing,—the instinctive
drawing back; and then a pounding of
the heart that did not yet dare to own its hidden
wells of affection.</p>

<p>With Van, however, she felt this reserve drop
away entirely. The little fellow gave his affection
so freely, and demanded hers so insistently,
that refusal would have been impossible. He expected
love, and it was his. Aunt Kate watched
this with a growing yearning in her motherly
heart, and caught glimpses now and then of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
wonderful blossom that might some day unfold
from the stubborn little calyx.</p>

<p>The winter days grew short, then longer; Van
waxed in greatness and importance on the Hill-Top,
and then, one Saturday morning he had an
experience that opened up new vistas. He, too,
began his Grammar School.</p>

<p>Dr. Peters came over, looking as if he had
something on his mind—something special.</p>

<p>“Miss Betsy,” he said, “Dr. Johns thinks Van
is old enough to try on Ward M. There are some
rats in the yard there that we cannot get rid of.”</p>

<p>Betsy gave her consent rather reluctantly.
Catching mice off one’s own vine and fig tree is
one thing, but being loaned out as a common rat-catcher
is another, and a bit beneath the dignity
of a Prince of the Blood.</p>

<p>Van himself had no such scruples. He went
joyfully, with a feeling that something unusual
was about to happen, and whatever it might be,
he would be the boy for it.</p>

<p>The yard on Ward M. was surrounded on three
sides by buildings, underneath which the rats had
burrowed and made fortresses for themselves.
No one could get at them without tearing down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
the foundations of the Hospital. This was the
yard where certain patients took their airing, and
the rats had become a pest and a nuisance.</p>

<p>Dr. Peters had a great scheme all planned out,
by means of which he hoped to make a clean sweep
of the enemy. There were to be three principal
actors—Van, the Fire-Hose and Himself. The
other doctors, six of them, came out and stood
around and got in the way, in the hope that they
might help a little, and at all events, see the fun.
They were like a lot of overgrown boys. Van
felt that he was in first-rate company, and pranced
around proudly, feeling from the glances they
cast upon him, and the words with which they
cheered him on, that, whatever was about to happen,
he was looked upon as the star performer.</p>

<p>The curtain went up when Dr. Peters fastened
the fire-hose to the hydrant, and the fire-hose
opened the melodrama with a great swish and
swirl. As the water filled it, it flapped and
writhed across the yard like a great boa-constrictor.</p>

<p>“Look out there! The water’s coming pretty
strong!”</p>

<p>The fat young doctor spoke too late. Dr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
Peters missed his cue, and the nozzle was jerked
out of his hand by the rushing stream of water.
The hose capered around the enclosure, and tied
itself up into bow-knots, as if it were the historical
sea-serpent in captivity. It pointed its nozzle
straight at a black-bearded young doctor, doubled
him up, put a crease in him, and left him gasping
and soaked. Then it turned its attention to Dr.
Peters, who was jumping like a chestnut on a
hot shovel, trying to get another grip without
being washed off the face of the earth. All the
other doctors scrambled off into safe corners, and
shouted directions to everybody, which nobody
heard. Van barked and tried to seize the wriggling
hose, but only succeeded in adding to the
general tumult. At last the fat young doctor
turned off the water at the hydrant, Dr. Peters
mopped his brow, the black-bearded young doctor
wrung the water out of his coat-tails, and the
show went on into the second act.</p>

<p>Gripping the nozzle-end of the hose firmly in
both hands, Dr. Peters aimed it at a rat-hole under
the steps.</p>

<p>“Now, Van, stand ready. Easy now! Let her
go at the hydrant,—not too fast on the start.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>The fire-hose came alive again. Dr. Peters
kept the nozzle turned off until things were quite
ready; Van stood by, all a-tremble with eagerness,—and
then——</p>

<p>Sh-sh-h-h-h-h! Squirt went a stream of water
strong enough to knock terror into the heart of
the stoutest rat on earth. Straight into the hole
this time, and no bungling.</p>

<p>A squealing sound, and out came flying a
drenched and much-befuddled rat.</p>

<p>No chance for him to make an exit. Snap!
The star performer had him by the back of the
neck. One little shake, a crunch, and all was
over. Another followed out of the same hole,—reluctantly.
It was only a question of choice for
him,—death by drowning, or raticide. The hose
was too much for him; he chose the latter, and
went the way of his brother.</p>

<p>Nothing more out of that hole. Dr. Peters
tried another. Squirt went the icy stream, and
out trailed a mother-rat and her nine half-grown
children.</p>

<p>Lively work for Van now. They scuttled in
every direction, all over the yard. Like a true
sportsman, Van tackled the mother first, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
good back-neck clutch, and she was done for.
Now for the rest!</p>

<p>Hither, thither, from Dan to Beersheba he
darted. No time now to make a clean finish;
every rat must be disabled before it could get
away to cover. And not one escaped. No historical
Herod was ever in the running with Van.
His agility was marvelous. It was dart, shake,
drop; dart, shake, drop;—nine times, and all
over the place.</p>

<p>Then he went the rounds again, and in a trice
the whole ten were ready to add to the heap of
slain.</p>

<p>Another hole. Two came out, and one doubled
and fled into the next hole before Van could get
him. All round the yard went the fire-hose, led
by Dr. Peters, sending its messenger into every
hole, and seldom failing to bring out one or more
victims.</p>

<p>It was a sweeping massacre, nothing more nor
less; the rats had no chance against that terrible
trio,—a doctor, a fire-hose, and a fox-terrier.
Twenty-six rodents were gathered to their fathers.</p>

<p>Dr. Peters and the fire-hose remained unchanged,
but Van went home a reconstructed dog,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
never more to be merely a cuddled, pampered
house-darling. Betsy shuddered when she looked
at him. He had a wild eye, a swagger, blood on
his white shirt-front and all over his coat. He
was a man-grown now, and had done a man’s
work. His only regret was that the lady of his
heart could not see the magnificent heap of slain.
But perhaps she would not have appreciated it.
He looked pityingly at Betsy. She was only a
girl. She could not go out into the world and
kill rats. Poor Betsy!</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“Ha! Ha! I’m sure the cat

</figure>

<p class="drop-cap">WHILE Betsy was busy at
school, the education of
Van did not come to a standstill.
But, alas! his new lessons were
not in the path of virtue. The
little Prince roamed the white
world over, all through the short
winter days, as far as his legs
would take him afield. He made
many friends, with a
royal disregard for social
standing, as other
princes have been
known to do, and before
spring came he
had fallen into the
hands of,—yes, of
thieves,—for they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
stole from him his good name and his character.</p>

<p>In the big Hospital there were many attendants,
who, having hours off duty, liked nothing better
than to amuse themselves with young Van, whose
beauty and bright, active ways had made him the
darling of the whole Hill-Top. Now, besides
those attendants, there were, around the building,
many, many cats—cats of all descriptions; pet
cats a few, and roving, wild cats a-many. There
were whole families of cats that had come up as
the flowers of the field, who toiled and spun not,
and who held themselves accountable to no one,
man or woman. They were a sad, bad lot, that
stole and laid waste the cupboards of the Hospital.
Nobody loved them and they loved nobody.
They had no manners or morals, and were
simply a band of robbers.</p>

<p>Now, on an evil day, some of the young men
decided that it would be a good and useful thing
to train Van as a slayer of cats as well as a catcher
of rats. Spring was coming on, and a new lot
of kittens had appeared on the scene, when, out
behind the buildings, where Dr. Johns could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
see them, a number of attendants smuggled Van,
one day, and turned him loose where the cats were
thickest.</p>

<p>They cheered him on and encouraged him in
every way possible, and he, being by birthright a
sporting gentleman, and the natural enemy of all
small animals, required very little training to
make him an expert “catter.” He needed no
coaxing. He still remembered that old yellow
Tommy that he had treed in his infancy. Betsy
and Mrs. Johns had laughed at that. It would
certainly be a delight to them if they could see
him wipe a whole family of good-for-nothing
kittens off the map. There was not even the memory
of a reproof to restrain him.</p>

<p>Those were wild, wicked days that followed,
and those lawless attendants applauded his misdeeds.
First the kittens disappeared, then the
middle-sized cats followed, though these were a
swifter lot, and he had to stalk and catch them
unawares. Then, for he was a man-grown now,
he tried the big old cats. If he could get them by
the backs of their necks it was all over with them;
but they grew wary, and the biggest ones would
fight back, with claws and teeth, leaving many a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
scar of battle on his brown head, that caused
Betsy to wonder.</p>

<p>Still, it was rare sport to chase these veterans,
and Van’s days abroad were one long series of
crimes. Home he would go at night, and sleep
the sleep of an angel in his basket in the kitchen.
In the morning he would be off to kill, kill, kill.</p>

<p>He did not stop at the Hill-Top. There were
neighbors who had cats. These he found, and
many a happy family was made desolate. Soon,
instead of being a well-behaved little dog, beloved
by all, he became a hated ruffian. Many a
time it was only the name on his collar that saved
him from being shot. For he wore a collar now,
with a brass plate, which announced to those who
could read as they ran, that he was owned by Dr.
Johns, of the big Hospital.</p>

<p>It was a long time before the family knew of
his sins, and when it finally came out it nearly
broke the heart of Betsy, and made Dr. Johns
look very grave indeed, and wonder if he had
not done right in objecting to his coming.</p>

<p>It was a warm April day, nearly a year since
Van had come to the Hill-Top to live. He was
taking his peaceful daily walk, with Betsy for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
company, and they wandered down into the flower
garden, where the pansies were beginning to
bloom in the cold-frames. Three pretty kittens
were frisking on the gravel walk, and Betsy
stopped to play with them.</p>

<p>Piff! Right under her nose Van caught one,
and had shaken the life out of it before she knew
what had happened. He laid it proudly at the
feet of her whose approval he desired.</p>

<p>“Van! Van! What are you doing? You bad
dog!”</p>

<p>Betsy’s voice had never sounded like that before.
To his surprise she caught him by the collar,
and before he could get at kitten number two,
she had given him a sound whipping.</p>

<p>This was most unexpected. He had thought to
see her in ecstasies of delight, as she was when he
had killed that first mouse. Now, how was this?
One person had taught him something, and another
was punishing him for it. Van was quite
bewildered. Tail down, he went home with his
mistress, ashamed and heart-broken over the first
severe punishment he had received at her hands.</p>

<p>However, it remained like this—he was grown
up, and no longer a baby and a coddled house-pet;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
he was not to be ruled by any one in petticoats.
Betsy might know rules for house manners, but
what could she know of the outside world! He
would abide by the teachings of men, as behooved
the son of royalty. Betsy’s little whippings were
not much, anyway!</p>

<p>So, although he went home in a very subdued
way, with his head drooping and his bark silent,
he was in no way minded to continue in obedience.
The bad way was so much more to his liking, too.
Do not men, and good men, go out with guns, and
shoot and kill innocent birds and squirrels, for
the mere sport of it? It is a gentleman’s sport—to
kill. Pity that it should be so! So we cannot
too severely blame a little dog for following
the instincts that grown men indulge in and are
never whipped for.</p>

<p>Everything seemed to be against Vanny-Boy’s
being a good dog. Mary the cook, and Treesa,
could not be bribed into punishing the winsome,
fascinating sinner. There was no one to do it
but Betsy, and she hated to worse than anybody.
But she loved the little Prince too well to let him
go on lightly in his wicked ways.</p>

<p>One evening, when it was just beginning to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
cat-time—every one knows that this is at twilight,
when the cats, who love darkness, shake themselves
out of their day naps, and prowl about
after mice and rats—Van escaped through the kitchen
door, and was off on a marauding expedition.</p>

<p>It was a lovely night, with a rising moon, and
a soft, still air that carried scents and sounds wonderfully;
a night simply perfect for cats, ay, and
for dogs, too, thought Vanny-Boy, as he scampered
over the wide lawn toward the Hospital
buildings. The birds in the nests were giving their
last sleepy chirps and tucking their heads under
their wings. Soon everything was still, save for
a chorus of frogs that chirped and boomed the
whole night through in the distant ponds.</p>

<p>Van sniffed the air.—Rat! He took the trail,
but it ended at a barred cellar window.</p>

<p>Sniff! Sniff! Surely that was Cat! Van doubled
back, and followed Kitty’s scent,—through the big
gate, across the road and through the fence into
the clover meadow beyond. Here it was very
still. Overhead the policemen fireflies were lighting
home the laggard bees from their day’s toil,
and lending their lantern rays to the operatic performances
of a cloud of young mosquitoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>Under the daisies and clover-heads stole the
black cat. There were rustlings and scurryings
among the field mice, I can tell you. A meadow
lark flew off and left her four white eggs until
the enemy had safely passed. But, oh, Pussy, even
as you were hunting <i>your</i> prey, there was one following
of whom it were best to be always wary!</p>

<p>Sh! Sh! There went a little field-mouse right
under Pussy’s nose. She jumped, she had him—almost!
Just then a brown and white streak
whizzed through the grasses, gave one leap over
the clover-tops, and—no—he, too, missed. She
was too quick for him; but, without intending to,
he had saved the life of the field-mouse, who scuttled
off in one direction as fast as Pussy in another.</p>

<p>There followed a sharp race. Pussy was big
and strong, and had she had time to turn and
show her claws, she might have fended for herself.
But Van was almost upon her—there was
nothing for it but flight. Through the clover,
first the black, then the white flew past; under
the fence, across the road, through the gate, over
the Hospital lawn, back to where they had started.
There, right ahead, stood a friendly maple tree;
one spring—and Pussy was safe! Vanny-Boy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
stood barking at the foot, as he had barked at
the yellow cat a year ago.</p>

<p>Pussy stopped on the first limb, turned around,
breathed a few times, to see if she still could, and
looked down at Van, a thing to be scorned and
flouted. He could not climb trees—not he! Ha,
ha! I am sure the cat must have laughed, just
like that.</p>

<p>That surely was a disappointment to Van. He
leaped vainly against the tree-trunk; he ran
around it in circles; he barked and barked.</p>

<p>Dr. Johns in the house looked up at Mrs.
Johns, who was reading aloud.</p>

<p>“Surely that is Van barking so loudly. I fear
he will disturb the patients.”</p>

<p>“That’s his bark, sure,” said Betsy, dropping
her work. “I’ll go out and fetch him.”</p>

<p>Now Betsy said that as if she were going out
to bring in an ordinary, obedient little dog. It
was easy to say.</p>

<p>She took down the whistle that she used to call
him. It sounded clear and shrill across the lawn.
There was no result. Van’s loud and insistent
barking did not change its tone one whit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>“Here, Van! Here, Van! Come here, Vanny-Boy!”</p>

<p>More barking, and a little louder and fiercer.</p>

<p>“Van!”—this was very stern—“Come here, I
say!”</p>

<p>More barking; then a sound of sniffling and
rustling, as if Pussy had gone down one tree and
scuttled up another.</p>

<p>Betsy sighed, put up the whistle and took down
the whip, and started in the direction of the tumult.
Under the tree she stopped and waved the
whip, with menace in her eye, which it was too
dark for Van to see, even if he had been looking
at her.</p>

<p>Van flitted to the far side of the tree, and
barked as vigorously as if she were not there.
Betsy started around after him; Van took the
other half of the circle; Betsy cut across to close
in on him; Van leaped to one side, dodged the
whip-lash, and darted to the base of the tree, as
if he would <i>make</i> that cat come down before the
fun was spoiled.</p>

<p>In vain. Pussy understood that Betsy was on
her side, and stood her ground, or, rather, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
stayed <i>climbed</i>, looking down in silent amusement
on the interesting spectacle below.</p>

<p>Round and round the tree went Van, with
Betsy after him, the whip almost swinging to him,
he always just ahead, or doubling so quickly that
she could not catch him.</p>

<p>“Wow, wow, wow!”</p>

<p>“Come here, I say!”</p>

<p>“Wow, wow, wow!”</p>

<p>Van was having the last word every time, for
Betsy was almost breathless. The poor patients
must have had a hard time of it trying to sleep
that evening.</p>

<p>“I will not give up my cat!” barked Van.</p>

<p>“Come here this instant!” called Betsy.</p>

<p>“Not if I know it! you can’t catch me!” barked
Van.</p>

<p>“I’ll get you yet, you young rascal!” panted
Betsy.</p>

<p>“My! but this is the best fun ever!”</p>

<p>“Just you wait till I get you. Then we’ll see!”</p>

<p>“I can tire her out and get the cat, too,”
thought Van, as he gave vent to a perfect chorus
of mad barks.</p>

<p>“I’ll get him if it takes all night,” said Betsy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
gritting her teeth. She could no longer run, so
she sat with her back against the tree, prepared to
spend the night there if necessary.</p>

<p>Not so wise was Van. He continued barking
and circling and tearing the night into shivers,
while his adversary rested and got her second
wind.</p>

<p>Now Betsy was up and at him again. Van
was tiring a bit; he looked around for help. He
gave up hope of getting the cat.</p>

<p>Not far away on the grass by the kitchen door
sat Mary, enjoying the sweet air, and, I suspect,
enjoying also the row that was going on under
the maple tree. Mary was his friend; Mary
would protect him. To her he flew.</p>

<p>But Betsy’s ideas were different. She knew
that something must be done and done quickly,
or her little Prince would become a nuisance and
a disgrace to his royal name. She had tired him
out in his excitement, and now the whip did its
work, while Van stood silently, taking his punishment
like a man and a gentleman. Silently he
crawled into his basket until the smarting was
over, and his little heart beat less violently and
he could think. He had sinned in haste; now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
there was leisure for repentance. His dear mistress
had been angry with him, and with good
cause. He had certainly given her a chase, and
a wild one, and he deserved his punishment.
Moreover, she had not come to say good-night
to him as usual. Queer!</p>

<p>The door of Betsy’s room opened a crack; a
little dog with sad eyes looked up into her face
as she sat on her couch, braiding her hair; an
appealing nose was laid on her knee.</p>

<p>“Van, are you sorry?”</p>

<p>That was not the voice of an angry mistress,
only a grieved one. There was hope. He burrowed
his muzzle in her hand as she stretched it
toward him; he whined a little note of love and
pleading, as a smile broke across her face; he
jumped upon the couch and looked straight into
her eyes, coaxing for the forgiveness that was
now so near at hand. With apologetic little
grunts he worked the muscles of his face, as if
he were trying to speak in her own language, and
tell her that he would try very hard to be good.
Only, she must forgive him when the heart of the
hunter in him beat too high for reasoning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“A little patience, oh, Betsy, my mistress. I
will try; oh, I will try to be a good dog.”</p>

<p>But it was hard to remember when the voices
of his ancestors called to him. Once when the
wayward little Prince had been more than usually
exasperating, Dr. Johns undertook to chastise
him. Solemnly and deliberately he went through
with the disagreeable duty, Van, as always,
crouching quietly and without a sound. He took
it like a soldier. A cur might howl for mercy,
might even lick the hand that hurt him, but not a
prince of the blood. When the whipping was over
he walked silently away, climbed into his basket,
curled up, and began to lick the places that stung.
There he thought it over, and later he bobbed up
as serenely as if he had quite forgotten or forgiven
the injury done him.</p>

<p>If Betsy thought that her uncle was going to
help her in the matter of Van’s training, she was
to be disappointed. The very next day, as she
stood in the door of the honeysuckle porch, waiting
for Dr. Johns to come home for lunch, she
saw him on the walk, with Van capering about
him.</p>

<p>What did that gray-haired back-slider do but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
sit down on the step, take Van’s bonny brown head
in his two hands, look straight into his fearless
eyes, and say,</p>

<p>“Vanny-Boy, I’ll never, never whip you again
as long as I live, no matter how bad you are. I’d
be ashamed to do it. I’m a great big man, and
you are so little and so pretty!”</p>

<p>Betsy stole softly away that Dr. Johns might
not know that she had overheard these promptings
of his gentle heart. But she knew now that
she had not one soul to help her; for Mrs. Johns
had long ago washed her hands of any part in
Van’s up-bringing, and spoiled him like the others.
She also knew that if she ever succeeded in making
Van as good as he was brave and fearless, she
would have to win the fight single-handed. She
said to herself, sadly,</p>

<p>“Aunt Kate has to teach me manners, because
I belong to her now, and I’ve got to teach Van,
because he belongs to me. I’m going to do my
duty.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>VAN BECOMES A HERO</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">VAN by this time knew the Hill-Top from
end to end, and for miles and miles on all
sides. His four feet and his delicate nose had
explored the whole countryside. He hunted with
Thatcher, he rode with the expressman, he
prowled whole mornings by himself. But, best
of all, he loved to chase after Betsy. As the days
grew longer, the little maid studied her lessons
in the afternoon, and took her walk with Van
after dinner. She said to Mary one evening, as
she routed Van out of his basket in the kitchen,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>“Where’s the whip, Mary? I must take it so
Van won’t chase cats.”</p>

<p>“Ah, now, Miss Betsy, he won’t be afther
hurtin’ the cats. He just do be havin’ his little
fun wit’ ’em.” Mary had no such tender feelings
where cats were concerned, and the Boy-Heart,
as she called him, should be allowed to follow his
pretty little instincts.</p>

<p>“Fox terriers is intinded to chase cats, Miss
Betsy, and whin he goes out wit’ me I lets him
have his pleasure. He do enj’y himsilf, to be
sure!” Mary would not have betrayed him if he
had killed half a dozen cats, and she rather unwillingly
handed the whip to Betsy, who started
off with Van.</p>

<p>They skirted the lawn down by the row of
maples, racing through the soft grass, while Van
barked at the long shadows, looking himself like
a thing of light in the level golden rays of the
sinking sun. By the flower garden they turned
up, between the two goldfish ponds. Van cared
nothing for the ponds—water was only a thing
to be avoided, anyway. The biggest one was the
very pond into which Thatcher had thrown him
when he was a baby. Betsy might stop, if she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
chose, to watch the darting fish, but Van hurried
through a tall hedge beyond. Here there might
be some hunting.</p>

<p>But all was still. They crossed back to the
walk, and swung around the South Building and
into Bow Lane. There was a collie dog in the
Lane; he was a friendly old fellow, and Van
stopped to pass the time of day with him.</p>

<p>Down Bow Lane they went for a bit, and then
turned into the grounds again, this time behind
the buildings. An English setter lived there, but
he was on a chain and did not count.</p>

<p>Now they came to a row of small buildings, and
here, in the days of his apprenticeship at the business,
there had been a perfect harvest of cats; cats
to be chased through fences, cats to be treed, cats
to be caught by their fearful mistresses and hurried
away to safety, at the sound of Van’s bark.
But now there were left only a few veterans that
backed up against walls and stood at bay, with
two rows of sharp teeth and twenty claws to bury
in him, if he ventured too near. Van respected
these old, seasoned cats. Summer and winter they
held their own and defied him, and knowing that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
Betsy held the whip, he was easily gotten past
Cat Row.</p>

<p>Betsy heaved a sigh of relief, however, when
the occasional spitting and sputtering, barking
and growling, was over, with no really violent
encounter, and they turned down past the carpenter
shops, and came upon Pig-Pen Alley. Here
was the grand game of all the games.</p>

<p>The pigs, in general, took no notice of Van,
but in and out of the pens darted rats. At sight
of Van they hurtled to cover in every direction.
They knew the enemy!</p>

<p>But to-night there was no sport, for Betsy did
not encourage him; instead she hurried him past
these possible scenes of bloodshed.</p>

<p>Beyond Pig-Pen Alley they came upon Silver
Street. Here lived two more collies, who barked
at Van and Betsy from behind a high hedge. On
from here they went up the grassy road, turned
in at the gate, rounded a clump of spruces, and
were in sight of Dr. Johns’ home.</p>

<p>Right here Van, with a sense of having been
cheated out of the best part of the walk by Betsy’s
womanish dislike for battle, decided for himself
that the evening’s entertainment was not over—not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span> 
his part of it, anyway. He turned suddenly,
and went straight back by the way he had come.</p>

<p>When Betsy went up the steps of the honeysuckle
porch, there was no Van at her heels. She
called, but he was nowhere to be seen, and he
made no answer.</p>

<p>Betsy whistled and called to him in vain. She
went into the house greatly troubled.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what came over him, Aunt Kate.
He seemed to forget something and go back
for it.”</p>

<p>“We won’t wait for him, Betsy. He’ll come
back before long, as gay as a lark.”</p>

<p>Meantime Van was alone and free to follow
his own sweet will. Down Silver Street he went,
stopping to bark defiance at the two collies. Then
he turned to the left, and went towards Toby
Hollow. Many times had he been there in the
daylight, but never before at night. It was a
delicious place, full of whispering mysteries of
leaf and insect. Little night noises and voices of
the underworld babbled around him, the trees bent
above him, like friendly giants, and the Dark was
soft and warm. There were depths to explore
that never existed in the daytime. Here a squirrel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
swished past almost within reach of Van’s
nose; now a woodchuck crossed his path, and he
tracked it to its hole and waited there, long and
vainly, for its reappearance. He would remember
that woodchuck, sometime, when Thatcher
was there to help him.</p>

<p>The night had long ago pulled down its velvety
curtains. Far away a little rooster, who
was just learning to crow, and was anxious to
get in extra practice, turned up his cracked little
voice: “Ruckety, ruckety r-r-r-r-r-r!” It made a
stir through all the chicken yards along the road;
Van barked a reply. If that meant morning he
must hurry on with his night-prowling. Dew-wet
but happy he turned back. The game in Toby
Hollow was too shy. He would go where he
knew his ground better.</p>

<p>Pig-Pen Alley again. Betsy was not here to
bother him now. He would make a round by
himself. Piff! there went a rat right across the
alley in front of him. Like a shot from a cannon
went Van through the palings and was hot on its
track. Down the alley they skimmed along. If
the rat could only hold out to that corner it
would be safe. It jumped for a hole, but Van<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
headed it off, and it turned into the darkness of
the great Cow Barn. There was no chance to
turn or double—Van was too near.</p>

<p>All was quiet there, for it was late in the night,
and good cows sleep when it is dark. Mr. Rat
scuttled along—the breath of the dog was on him;—oh,
for a place to hide!</p>

<p>At the far end, beyond the long rows of gently
breathing cattle, was an enclosed stall, built of
cement, and strewn with clean straw. Just now
it was occupied by a mother cow and her baby
calf, only a day old. A sack of corn leaned
against the stall, and with a leap the rat was behind
it. Van tipped the bag over, but at that instant
the rat had found a knot-hole in the wooden
door, and was on the inside. Van could not go
through a knot-hole.</p>

<p>But there were other ways, and he did not intend
to give up the chase—not yet! The stall
was only four feet high, and there was the sack
of corn. On this Van scrambled. With a leap
he caught the edge of the stall with his paws; a
spring and a wriggle, and he, too, was inside.</p>

<p>He landed on something warm and soft; a
something around which the rat ran, escaping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
again by the hole where he had entered; a something
which gave an astonished “moo!” at the disturbance
of her rest; a something which rose out
of the pitch darkness like a black mountain.
Mother Cow would see what was destroying the
slumbers of her baby and herself. Huge and
awful she was, for a mother cow with her little
one is no child’s toy. Had it been daylight she
could easily have made an end of poor Van, with
her wicked horns.</p>

<p>As it was she stood there, blinking and grumbling,
with a threat in her throat, and a warning
also to the wabbly baby, that crowded in behind
her great bulk, where it would be safe from
danger.</p>

<p>Mother Cow was quite enough for Van, however.
She stood there, fearsome and menacing,
and Van faced her—the biggest problem he had
ever tackled. She looked formidable indeed; he
certainly could not get her by the back of the
neck and shake her. He decided not to rush the
lady, but to fight shy, and for time. He must be
brave, look her down, and not flinch.</p>

<p>He made no sound. Somehow the valiant little
figure, standing his ground before her, made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
Brindle hesitate about attacking in her turn.</p>

<p>She shook her horns threateningly, but took no
step toward him. Van stood motionless. The
minutes crept slowly by.</p>

<p>At the far end of the big cow-barn appeared
the light of a swinging lantern. The night-watchman
was going his rounds to see that all was safe.
Van gave one long howl. Perhaps he would be
rescued. The man hesitated—yes, he was coming!—No,
he had decided that some dog outside
had made the noise. All seemed peaceful in the
cow-barn, and he did not go in, but disappeared
down toward Cat Row.</p>

<p>Van whined despairingly, but the man was now
out of hearing. Another hour must be lived
through before help could come again.</p>

<p>There was not one thing in the stall on which
Van could climb and make his way to safety, and
four feet were more than he could jump. The
walls, bare and smooth, closed him in. There
was no light, save that which struggled through
a high, cobwebby window, from the far-away
stars.</p>

<p>No help anywhere! nothing to do but wait and
wait till the night-watchman came back; always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
to hold his ground, and never to lose his nerve!
He squared himself to the task.</p>

<p>The baby calf grew chilly and cried. Mother
Cow backed closer to it, almost stepping on it
with her great awkward cloven hoofs. It pressed
into the corner, and its little body was warmed
against hers. It stopped shivering, lay down,
and at last slept.</p>

<p>The minutes went on, and the quarter-hours.
Van slipped backward slowly, warily, until he
could brace himself in the far corner of the stall.
Always he kept his eyes on the enemy, his head
lowered to point, his stump-tail straight and alert,
his forelegs ready for a spring, his hind legs
wide and rigid,—ready for the on-rush that
might come at any minute. He grew stiff and
cold.</p>

<p>The chimes in the clock tower of the Middle
Building sounded,—then the great bell struck
One! The light appeared again in the doorway.
Van whined.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” called the night-watchman.</p>

<p>Van did not answer. So a-tremble was he with
eagerness and nervous excitement that he did not
think to sound again his alarm-signal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>The night-watchman looked in, but the aisle
between the rows of cattle was empty, save for
the over-turned bag of corn. He lifted his lantern
high, and looked into the stalls nearest him.
All quiet everywhere.</p>

<p>“Now he is coming,” thought Van, and he stood
silent and quivering, never taking his eyes from
the enormous foe who seemed to grow bigger in
the dim lantern-light. She faced him as before,
and neither made a sound. The watchman turned,
and went out into the night.</p>

<p>Van shuddered, and the great mountainous mass
lowed ominously, and swayed from side to side.
If he stirred a hair out of his place she would be
upon him with her horns.</p>

<p>Another slow hour must creep around. Van’s
nerves were near the breaking point, but he must
hold on. If only he could have done something,
it would have been easier. But he could not rush
a monster like that. He had no weapons with
which to fight dragons. More than one knight
in the fairy tales has been chewed up because he
attempted the impossible, or lost his guard for
an instant. He must simply stand there, with
every nerve and muscle in hand. He must not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
move, and thus bring on the unequal struggle, in
which he would certainly be killed. If the struggle
came he would fight, and fight to his finish.
Until then he must simply stand at bay. Help
might come even yet.</p>

<p>Courage and endurance! Courage and endurance!
Could he last another hour?</p>

<p>The chimes struck the half-hour—three-quarters—then
the welcome One—Two! Soon the
door would grow light again. Yes, there he was—the
watchman!</p>

<p>A quavering cry that was almost a sob, broke
from Van. “Oh, come to me!” he seemed to say,
“I cannot hold out much longer.”</p>

<p>The Mother Cow swayed and grumbled, once—twice.
She, too, was tiring. Why not rush
him and have it over?</p>

<p>“Hello!” said the night-watchman. “What’s
the trouble? That sounds like something in distress.”</p>

<p>This time he came in and went down the long
aisle. At the very end he stopped and looked
over into the box-stall. There stood the cow in
one corner, with her baby lying huddled behind
her, her great mother-eyes, fierce with fear, looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
straight into the brave brown eyes of a wee
dog. Even then Van did not stir. He must
hold that awful thing back by the force of his
will, until the last moment of danger was over.</p>

<p>The night-watchman reached over and lifted
Van out by his collar. At his touch the little hero
crumpled up with a piteous whine that went
straight to the heart of his rescuer. Then he lay
still in the man’s arms.</p>

<p>The night-watchman looked him over and
whistled. On his collar he read “Vanart VI.”
He did not stop to read more.</p>

<p>“It’s the Boss’s dog, sure. Well, of all the
pluck! He must have been here two or three
hours. I’m sure I heard something at twelve
and at one, but I never dreamed it was inside the
building. How he held out against that cow I
don’t see. All mothers are fierce when their
young is in danger. You certainly have got the
grit, young fellow. I make my bow to you.”</p>

<p>He picked up his lantern and was off at a
swinging stride toward Dr. Johns’ house. Van
lay silent until his breath returned, his heart beat
steadier, and his nerves lost their terrible tension.
Then his self-respect came to him. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
could not bear to be brought home in a man’s
arms. Betsy or Mary might tote him around a
little, if he were tired or sleepy,—but any one
else,—oh, no, indeed!</p>

<p>With a wriggle and a plunge he slipped from
the hold of the astonished night-watchman, who
stood with his mouth open, watching him disappear
through the dark, like a small goblin, in the
direction of home.</p>

<p>The man looked after him, and laughed.</p>

<p>“The little tyke’s a sport all right, all right!
I sh’d think I’d seen a ghost if I hadn’t had hold
of him.”</p>

<p>Betsy lay in her bed, listening for the clear
bark that would sound across the lawn sooner or
later.</p>

<p>Instead, at the very door of the house she
heard a pitiful wail, and she bounded up to let
in a trembling creature, a little Prince, with all
the princeliness gone out of him; he looked no
better than the meanest mongrel that ever lived.</p>

<p>Not until the next day, when the night-watchman
told his story, did she know that her Vanny-Boy
was a real hero.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>THE GREAT PARADE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SCHOOL was over, and it was very near the
Fourth of July. Betsy had never seen a
celebration, and neither had Van, for that matter,
as there had been no demonstrations at the
Hospital the year before.</p>

<p>But this year there was to be a grand parade;
it was to take place on the grounds, for the entertainment
of the patients. For weeks the attendants
at the Hospital had been spending their
odd moments in making costumes. There were
to be floats of every kind filled with revelers, and
those who could not ride were to join the procession
on foot, decked out with the bravest.
After the parade there would be lemonade and
peanuts for everybody, with fireworks in the
evening.</p>

<p>Betsy was greatly excited. She had been asked
to dress as one of a party of haymakers, and ride
in a big haywagon, all draped with red, white,
and blue. Her big brown eyes danced as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
talked it over the evening before, with Treesa
and Mary.</p>

<p>“Why can’t the Boy-Heart ride wit’ you in the
waggin?” said Mary. “He’d make a foine show,
sittin’ up so grand besoide yez.”</p>

<p>“He’d be great!” said Betsy, clapping her
hands. “I’ll put his chain on him, so he can’t get
away. He’ll be the finest thing in the show. I’ll
ask Aunt Kate. Van, do you want to ride in the
procession?”</p>

<p>Van knew well enough they were talking about
him. He barked his willingness to take part in
anything that promised excitement and a good
time, and to play any part, from the Lion to
Thisbe. Aunt Kate looked a little dubious, but
seeing the light in Betsy’s face, she consented.</p>

<p>And that evening Treesa and Mary put their
heads together. Early on the morning of the
great day they called to Van, and from Treesa’s
room came forth sounds of scuffling and much
laughter, ending with a series of barks. Then a
little dog burst from the room and danced into
the front of the house, with his eyes sparkling,
and his spirits so gay that he needs must get his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
rope, and have Betsy shake it up with him for a
little.</p>

<p>Later he heard Treesa calling, “Here, Pansy,
Pansy! Come here, Pollywog—come here again.”
(Van’s nicknames among his friends were many
and varied.)</p>

<p>He ran to her, capering recklessly, and this
time there was less scuffling, and more laughter
and barking. When he reappeared, he was the
spirit of mystery itself. I doubt, had he been
able to talk English, if he could have kept the
secret into which he had been taken.</p>

<p>It was just the kind of a day the weather-man
should always pick out for the Fourth of July.
Sunny and breezy it was; not too hot, not too cold.
The preparations went merrily on, and at a quarter
to ten Betsy looked for Van, as the festivities
were to begin at ten sharp.</p>

<p>But Van did not appear.</p>

<p>“I wonder where he is?” said Mrs. Johns. “I
hope nothing has happened.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see if he is in the kitchen,” said Betsy,
and just then the swinging door opened, and in
came Van—Vanart the Prince, prancing proudly
on his hind legs, dressed in the bluest of overalls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
with white polka dots and shoulder straps; a
snowy shirt, one of Treesa’s collars, and a great
red Windsor tie at his throat. His forepaws
waved out of tiny cuffs; these, with the other two
that appeared to be treading on air, his brown
head and his stump of a tail sticking through a
hole made for it in his overalls, were all the evidence
to prove that he was still a dog.</p>

<p>He was as proud as a peacock, and as pleased
with the effect of his costume as if he had thought
it all up himself and made the clothes. There
was no hint of the first struggle, when Treesa
and Mary had tried the clothes on; nor of the
second, when they taught him how to wear them
and he had tolerated the garments for love of the
makers. He wore his suit like a man, and looked
delightfully self-conscious.</p>

<p>The applause was loud and long, quite enough
to satisfy even the vain little Prince, who loved
nothing better than being noticed. He felt that
already he had made the hit of the day.</p>

<p>“The overalls and the shirt will be simply perfect
for the haywagon,” laughed Mrs. Johns.
“How did you ever think of it? The collar and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
the red tie are the finishing touches. He’ll be
the observed of all observers.”</p>

<p>“And patriotic, too,” said Betsy. “Look at the
colors—red, white and blue! He’s just grand!”</p>

<p>Van was wriggling with the excitement of the
affair. The final adjustment of his red Windsor
tie was the hardest to bear, it took so long for
Treesa and Betsy to set the bows right; still
longer, because they were laughing at Van’s comical
pride in himself. When at last he went capering
over the lawn at the end of the chain which
Betsy held tightly, he was quite too much for the
family, who were assembled on the honeysuckle
porch, shaking with laughter.</p>

<p>“It’s the foine b’y he is!” said Mary from her
station on the kitchen walk.</p>

<p>“He’ll be the whole show, or I miss my guess,”
said Treesa.</p>

<p>“It’s the kapin’ of him in the waggin that I’m
doubtin’. I hope she do be havin’ a tight hould
on the collar of him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll be all right. He’s so conceited and
proud of his clothes that he’ll keep straight.”</p>

<p>Behind the great buildings the procession was
forming, with all sorts of strange people running<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
to and fro. Masked figures in petticoats that
were flaunted with distinct masculine awkwardness,
pretty young girl-attendants in red, white,
and blue, and wearing liberty-caps, children in
gay costumes, Uncle Sams and clowns. There
were wagons filled with farm-hands, bicycles
transformed into whirling rosettes of color, floats
bearing the “States,” from Texas to Rhode Island.
Every spare attendant and every vehicle on the
place was pressed into service. All the employees
and their families were there,—even some of the
jolly young doctors took part in the motley show.</p>

<p>The procession started out on the mile-long
driveway that surrounded the Hospital buildings,
and it was truly gorgeous. Betsy’s happy face
shone from the seat on the haymakers’ wagon,
where she sat proudly with the driver, holding
Van beside her.</p>

<p>People from the town and country around, who
had turned out to see the parade, laughed at the
perky little head with its red necktie, while from
many windows the patients shouted all sorts of
greetings to his small Magnificence.</p>

<p>“Hello, Van!”</p>

<p>“Ain’t he the dude!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>“Get onto them overalls!”</p>

<p>“Hi, there, Van; lend us your necktie!”</p>

<p>Van bobbed his head every time he heard his
name, and enjoyed the whole show as if it had
been planned for him alone. He was in his element—the
very center of admiration. Betsy felt
that she was doing her whole duty by her part
of the exhibit. All was going forward as merrily
as possible until——</p>

<p>Van looked ahead and saw something in the
procession—a small object that had up to now
escaped his notice; as they rounded a curve he
had a second glimpse of it. One of the attendants,
dressed as a clown, was leading a very much bescrubbed
and shining young pig. Van was now
wide awake.</p>

<p>Piggy was pink as the flush of dawn. He wore
a large bow of red, white, and blue ribbon which
annoyed him exceedingly. Moreover, he was
naturally timid and retiring, and did not like being
dragged around by a string in the midst of such
queer-looking people. He was distinctly uncomfortable.
Piggy protested, and it was his squealing
that first drew Van’s attention.</p>

<p>Now Van knew pigs—none better; but this was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
a new kind. He did not stop to consider that
he himself was groomed and arrayed and fit to
kill—that he was quite as funny as the funniest.
His one desire was to get a closer view of the
strange, uncanny beast. He gave a leap; and almost
went over the dash-board, but Betsy was on
her guard and held him back. She took a firm
grip on his leather collar, which he wore under
Treesa’s, and tried to steady him. He wriggled
backward under her arm, leaving the collar and
chain in Betsy’s hands, while he slipped down behind
her, yelping and barking, into the midst of
the merrymakers in the hayrick.</p>

<p>Instantly there was uproar and confusion. One
caught at his tail, but it was too short to be useful;
another grabbed him by his red necktie, and
it came away, an unsightly string. Another
snatched at his white collar; that also came loose.
Some one took a firm hold upon his shirt-front;
he gave a mighty squirm, and behold, he was no
longer in that shirt! It dangled in the hands of
the astonished haymaker. Leaping and wriggling,
Van, at top speed, made a pilgrim’s progress
from hand to hand, down the whole length
of the hayrick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>Betsy was on the ground now; she ran around
to the rear, and amid a chorus of gleeful yells
from the crowd, she caught her charge as he
jumped. The procession had stopped, so Van’s
side-show had full swing. He struggled desperately,
and was out of Betsy’s arms, leaving the
last remnant of his respectability—his overalls—in
her hands, and was after that pig.</p>

<p>Piggy was quite unprepared. With nerves already
wrought to a high tension by the crowd, and
the unaccustomed grandeur of his necktie, the
sight of Van bearing down upon him was too
much. He squealed as never pig squealed before,
and tugged at his gala harness in frantic terror.
Van leaped upon him; he tore the offending ribbon
bow from his neck; he tried to catch him somewhere,
and shake him up, but Piggy was a pachyderm,
plump and solid,—and that means that Van
could not find one spot on his whole pink exterior
where a restraining tooth could be fastened.</p>

<p>Piggy squealed louder; it was an awful moment.
One more wild lunge, and the leash flew out of
the clown’s hands. With a bound Piggy was off
across the lawn, sprinting at a gait so lively that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
any razor-back of the wildwood would have been
proud to own him as a relative.</p>

<p>Van was hard at Piggy’s heels, in spite of the
efforts of the bystanders to catch him; the clown
followed Van, Uncle Sam followed the clown; a
haymaker went streaking after Uncle Sam; a male
attendant in petticoats gathered up his skirts and
followed the haymaker—it was far more stirring
than the ride of the Miller of Dee.</p>

<p>The whole of the United States stood up in
their floats and shrieked with joy, Rhode Island
and California clasping hands, as the mad procession
went whirling by. Those who did not join
in the chase stood cheering and holding their sides
and offering good advice.</p>

<p>“Ten to one on the pig!”</p>

<p>“I put my money on the clown!”</p>

<p>“I’m for Van, strong!”</p>

<p>“Hurry, hurry, Uncle Sam. You’re getting
left!”</p>

<p>That was an unparalleled race, long to be remembered
in the annals of Fourth of July festivities;
history hath not its like.</p>

<p>It ended abruptly.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Van caught up with Piggy at the far end of the lawn</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Van caught up with Piggy at the far end of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
lawn, just as the clown arrived and made a dive
for Piggy’s leash. There was a struggle, a blur
of pink and white, and then Uncle Sam threw his
red and blue into the kaleidoscope. The gentleman
in petticoats fell, last of all, upon the whole
bunch, eclipsing them with his voluminous draperies.</p>

<p>When they arose from the scrimmage, Uncle
Sam held Van in a deadly grip, while Piggy was
led away, squealing with rage and terror. Still
keeping his strangle-hold upon Van, Uncle Sam
strode back to the driveway, delivered the protesting
culprit into Mary’s hands, and mounted his
float once more, a hero, who had saved his country’s
honor and his country’s pig from annihilation.</p>

<p>The procession moved on, and every one voted
that Van’s impromptu act with the pig was the
prize feature of the whole show.</p>

<p>Mary shut the door on him.</p>

<p>“Did ye see the likes of that, now! Little imp
that ye are,—sp’ilin’ the parade!</p>

<p>“No, ye’ll not get out ag’in, till the merrymakin’
do be over. Go to bed in yer baskit, ye little spalpeen!
Ye’ve disgraced us all.”</p>

<p>Then later:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>“If they had hurted ye, Boy-Heart, I’d be afther
givin’ ’em what they desairve. An’ yer nice
clothes, too, that was so pretty! What did ye
do wit’ ’em, annyhow? An’ what’ll Miss Betsy
be doin’ to yez?”</p>

<p>When the parade was over and Betsy had returned
to the house, she looked Van over despairingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Vanny-Boy! After all I’ve taught you
about manners—think what you’ve done. You’ve
disturbed a good pig who wasn’t trying to do
anything but look beautiful. You’ve been disobedient.
You’ve let your feelings run away with
you. No decent dog was ever so dirty. Your
lovely clothes are gone, I don’t know where, and
you pretty near upset the whole parade. I’m
ashamed of you clear to my toes. And here I’ve
been trying to bring you up to be a real gentleman.”</p>

<p>The fallen princeling apologized so abjectly
that Betsy could not help laughing at him, for
after all, it had been funny.</p>

<p>But sure enough, the nice clothes—where were
they?</p>

<p>The necktie never came back. Some one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
handed Betsy the mangled remains of the shirt
and collar; the overalls were missing.</p>

<p>One day, the following summer, Betsy saw a
bit of blue calico with white polka dots sticking
out from under the edge of the summer-house.
She drew it out—the damp, mildewed, faded
remnant of Van’s past glory and shame.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>VAN IN DISGRACE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">VAN never forgot anything that he wanted to
remember. Away back in the time of his
puppyhood Betsy had laughed when he had
chased an old hen.</p>

<p>When the cats were pretty well thinned out,
he, in his solitary excursions, chanced on some
half-grown chickens. He chased them a little,
and they fluttered and scrambled awkwardly away
from him. Now anything that runs is to be
chased. Van always chased Betsy when she ran
with him on the lawn; yes, and he would growl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
and shake her skirts. It would be good fun to
see what these ungainly birds would do.</p>

<p>So he went for them, and they came right up
to his expectations; they plunged across the road,
squawking and crying.</p>

<p>This was delightful! He would try nipping
them.</p>

<p>That was still better fun. Pretty soon he
caught one, gave it a little shaking up, and it lay
quite still and limp. He turned to find a livelier
one, but just then the mistress of the house where
he was trespassing, saw him, and he received a
good banging over the head with a broom.</p>

<p>He concluded that he had had enough sport
for one day, and went home. An hour later a
boy from the house where the chickens lived, went
to Dr. Johns’ office with a dead chicken in his
hand, for which Dr. Johns promptly paid. It
appears that chickens have a market value which
cats have not, and one may not destroy them so
freely.</p>

<p>To punish Van away from the game would
have been useless. Dr. Johns gave forth the order
that he must be kept at home, and not allowed
out except on a chain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>This was terrible. Van’s life had been one
long joy, with no confinement whatever, except
in those early mad-dog days. The whole world
had been his, and now it was taken away from
him—from him, Prince Vanart VI.!</p>

<p>But alack and alas! this did not cure him. One
morning he slipped out through a carelessly unlatched
door, and was off down the hill as fast
as his little legs could carry him.</p>

<p>By some luck—hard luck for Vanny-Boy—Betsy
saw him and started after him at the top
of her speed, stopping only long enough to take
the whip. At the foot of the hill stood a house
with a chicken-yard behind it. A few stately old
biddies were stalking around the lawn after worms
and insects, while a still statelier old rooster
strutted up and down importantly.</p>

<p>Van saw them and turned in. He must make
the most of his liberty, and no time was to be
lost. He grabbed at an old white hen, but she
was too heavy for him. He turned away with his
mouth full of feathers and tackled another with
the same result. By this time the whole lawn
was in an uproar, and had it not been so early in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
the morning some one from the house must certainly
have seen him.</p>

<p>Betsy was on the way, however, and she advanced
to the rescue of old hen number three.
Van was very busy indeed, but these hens were
all too big. He gripped another, with one eye
on the rooster;——</p>

<p>Down came the whip over his back, just missing
him, for he was now on his way to the chicken-yard,
where the birds were smaller. Betsy followed,
and just as he made a dash for a nice
broiler, she stepped inside and closed the gate
behind her.</p>

<p>The instant Van heard the click of the gate he
knew that the jig was up. He stood still, took
in the situation, saw that there was no hope, and
came straight to his mistress. Down at her feet
he lay, ready for the inevitable whipping.</p>

<p>Oh, valiant little sinner! Why did you always
make it so hard for those who had to punish you?
One may whip a coward, and feel that he deserves
it, but with two brave eyes looking up, not even
begging for mercy, a white body that will quiver,
but not cringe under the lash, with no sound of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
protest—how can one do it? Betsy needed all
her own courage for the task.</p>

<p>Without a whimper the plucky little dog went
back to the house on his chain, and care was redoubled
to keep him at home. He showed no
remorse. He had had his fun and taken his punishment.
Chickens were decidedly the best sport
yet, and his blood continued to leap at the sight
of a feathered temptation.</p>

<p>Poor Betsy! She was at her wits’ end. What
could she do? The neighbors would not stand
for this sort of thing, and the day would come
when some one would kill him, and no one could
blame the doer of the deed. It could not matter
to strangers what an adorable bit he was in his
own home. Indoors he obeyed like an angel, out-of-doors
he tossed his head and went his wicked
ways.</p>

<p>Here was a problem that Betsy could not
solve. The small sinner knew very well that he
was doing wrong, and he knew that punishment
followed, if he was caught. But he knew also
that whippings do not last forever, and while
the chase was on, he could not think of what was
to follow—only a savage red triumph filled his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
brain. Nothing else mattered for the moment.
Those days with the Hospital attendants were
having their effect.</p>

<p>What should she do?</p>

<p>Once more Betsy tried him. She took him
walking off the chain, but with the whip in her
hand. It made no difference. He turned in at
the first gate where his little nose said, “Chicken!”
and this time he left four half-grown victims dead
on the field, and got clean away, without the
whip’s once touching him.</p>

<p>The owner of the chickens came over and displayed
the results of Van’s foray to Dr. Johns.
He paid for the chickens, but he looked very
grave, and Betsy trembled.</p>

<p>Then the Johns family sat in judgment on the
culprit. Something must be done. Punishment
had no effect on that proud spirit. Somehow they
must shame him. Dr. Johns had heard it said
that if one hung the dead chicken on the collar
of the dog, it would cure him of killing. At
least the thing could be tried. With tears Betsy
heard the verdict.</p>

<p>A red pullet was selected from the day’s kill,
and tied to Van’s collar, like the albatross around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
the neck of the Ancient Mariner, and thus he
was chained on the lawn near the house.</p>

<p>And why this was done Van did not understand.
That was the worst of it. Possibly, had
the chicken been tied to him at the moment of
the killing, he would have known it to be a just
punishment for his slaughter of the innocent.
But as it was he did not recognize in that dead,
limp Thing, the flapping, squawking broiler he
had so gayly murdered. When life had passed
from his game he had no more use for it. How
could he understand?</p>

<p>But there it was, and he could not get away
from it. Furtively he tried to move off where
he could not see it; it moved with him. He
went to the length of his chain in one direction,
then the other; still it followed, dragging grewsomely
at his side. Turn as he would, there was
the Thing, feathered and awful, close to him,
hanging to him! Oh, the shame of it! He suffered
as bitterly as if he were the first in all
the wide world to be so punished.</p>

<p>And misery upon misery! this debasement was
public, for all the world to see; and people came
and looked at him, and talked about his sinfulness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
and he knew they were talking about him.
Even Dr. Peters, his friend, came across the
lawn to see how he took it. Van slunk away
to the end of his tether, and tried to hide, oh,
anywhere. There was nothing to hide behind
but the hated chicken, and he put his head under
that. He would not look up, no matter how kindly
Dr. Peters spoke.</p>

<p>The fat young doctor came and looked at him,
and the black-bearded young doctor came and
looked at him. Did they have no hearts? Could
they not see that all he wanted was to get down
into the bottomless pit of oblivion, where there
were no curious eyes to pierce him through and
through?</p>

<p>Then Betsy came, and she sent the curious ones
to the right-about. She sat down by him, and
looked sorrowfully at him, and he gazed up at
her with his pitiful brown eyes, and saw that
his dear mistress understood. He knew that
there must be some reason why she could not set
him free from his loathsome burden. He hid
his head in her skirts and whined.</p>

<p>“Vanny-Boy, Vanny-Boy,” she said, “it has to
be. When we’re bad or ign’rant we have to learn.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
It’s just like when Aunt Kate put those black
spots on my nails. I was as ’shamed as ’shamed.
But it made me remember.”</p>

<p>But Van would not be comforted, for he did
not really understand. All day he neither ate
nor drank, although there was a bowl of water
placed for him, and a plate of most delectable
viands prepared especially by Mary. At nightfall
Betsy came again, and he lay still, without
a sound, as if the fountains of grief had dried
up within him. Betsy held a bowl of cool water
to his lips, and from her hands for the first
time he drank thirstily. He even tried to swallow
a few morsels of food that she gave to him.
But he felt no hunger, only a gnawing shame
for something he did not comprehend, and his
only comfort was Betsy’s sympathy. Her he
could always trust, for <i>she knew</i>, and whether he
was glad or sorry, triumphant or remorseful,
defiant or humble, always she knew the fine,
brave, fearless, loving little heart that lay beneath
all his deeds or misdeeds, and she did not
sit in judgment without sweet Charity at her side.</p>

<p>When the dew fell she led him into the cellar,
for with his “Albatross” he might not sleep in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
cosy basket. A soft bed was made for him in
the furnace room; he sidled into it, and lay down,
without a sound.</p>

<p>All night he crouched there in the dark with
that awful thing beside him; moving when he
moved, motionless when he lay still. Sleep did
not come to his eyes. His fearsome companion
lay so stark and stiff, his companion that he could
not get away from. It destroyed all thought of
rest, and filled him with a wide-eyed horror; it
was a long, lonesome, terrible night.</p>

<p>Early in the morning his mistress came down
with a delicious breakfast, but he would not
touch it. He looked up at her with great eyes
hollow with suffering, and made one pitiful little
moan, so low that she could scarcely hear it, and
laid his nose on her knee with a long shudder.</p>

<p>Betsy could bear it no longer. She had slept
no more than had the culprit. She dashed upstairs
for a knife with which to cut the hateful
burden loose; she tried to lead him up the stairs,
but the ordeal had so shaken his nerves that he
could not mount the steps.</p>

<p>Then she carried him up in her arms; she gave
him a warm bath, and laid him on her own bed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
He was mutely grateful, but his shame and disgrace
had laid him low.</p>

<p>For three days Van was very ill. Whether it
was the shock of the dreadful punishment, or of
knowing that his loved ones could treat him so—for
still he did not understand—who can tell?</p>

<p>“If he kills all the chickens in the world, I’ll
earn the money to pay for them myself,” cried
Betsy. “But I can’t stand that look in his poor
eyes!”</p>

<p>And there was no one in the whole family but
felt that a mistake had been made, that all this
had been for nothing. And it was even so. Van
was up and around again soon, bright and winsome
as ever, but Betsy and Dr. and Mrs. Johns
never forgave themselves. Somehow the punishment,
terrible as it was, did not bring home its
lesson, and in spite of all the suffering, it did not
one particle of good. The love of battle, murder,
and sudden death was in his blood, and his
first training had been all wrong.</p>

<p>The Johns family held another meeting to
which Van was not invited, and in it they came
to this decision:</p>

<p>That: whereas they could not themselves make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
a good dog of Vanart VI., he must be sent away
to a trainer—to a kind of college where dogs
are taught their manners, their tricks, and their
duties; and where, if it is not too late, they may
unlearn their bad habits and wicked ways.</p>

<p>On that last night before he went away, Mary
cooked for Van the most wonderful supper. He
reveled in the tid-bits that he coaxed from every
one at the dinner table. Best of all, he was permitted
to sleep on the foot of Betsy’s bed. He
did not know the reason for all this extra indulgence,
but he joyfully took the goods the gods
provided.</p>

<p>“Kate,” said Dr. Johns, when Betsy had said
good-night, and gone to her room, “there’s another
letter from that scoundrel. He takes quite
a threatening attitude, plays the high and mighty,
says we are keeping his child away from him
unlawfully. The fond parent wants his beloved
child, etc. It is sickening, when we know what
he really wants her for, and that she would probably
be abused and starved again. He might try
to get her in some way. I thought I’d better tell
you, so we can be on our guard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>“What could he do?”</p>

<p>“Everything, unless the courts decide in our
favor. I’ve arranged for the earliest possible
hearing. It may not be until spring, however,
but we can easily prove him incompetent as a
father. Betsy has no love for him, and would
certainly choose us, and that would help. And
when we are assured that we have the custody of
the child, we’ll adopt little Betsy, regularly and
in order. What do you say, Kate?”</p>

<p>For answer Kate put her arms around her
husband, and kissed him tenderly.</p>

<p>Late that evening, as Aunt Kate was going
the rounds of the house, she stopped at Betsy’s
door and listened. The sound of a long-drawn
gasping breath met her ears, and she opened the
door softly and went in.</p>

<p>The dim light of the moon shone in at the
southern window, and Betsy lay at the foot of
her couch with one arm tightly around Van. The
little Knave of Hearts slept as soundly as if he
had been a good, obedient dog all his life.</p>

<p>Aunt Kate sat down beside the little maid, and
Betsy’s free hand stole into hers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>“Don’t cry, Betsy dear. He’ll come back all
right, and be a good dog forever after.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem—it doesn’t seem,” sobbed
Betsy, “as if I could possibly live without
him.”</p>

<p>“Betsy mine,” Aunt Kate squeezed the little
hand tighter, “do you know how we have grown
to love you? I haven’t wanted to force you; I
wanted you to come to me of your own free will,
but I must say just this; when you get big enough
to understand, you will know that Uncle Ben
and Aunt Kate never had any little children, and
they wanted them; and there’s a place all ready
in their hearts. And when little Betsy is ready
she can crawl right in and stay there.”</p>

<p>One great sob burst from Betsy, a sob that
seemed to break open the very flood-gates of
life. She lifted both arms and put them tightly
around Aunt Kate’s neck.</p>

<p>“Auntie Kate, Auntie Kate,” she whispered,
and in the dark she was not ashamed. “I do love
you and I love Uncle Ben. I wouldn’t ever want
anybody better in the whole wide world.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall be the happiest woman on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
Hill-Top, and with a little girl of my own to
love me.”</p>

<p>“And when Vanny-Boy comes back,” said
Betsy, “we’ll be the very happiest family that
ever was.”</p>

<small>VAN’S BANISHMENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was late September,
with a blue
haze on the hills, and a
low sun, that made the
red trees redder and
the yellow trees yellower,
just the kind of
a day for a little dog to
run abroad, wild and
free and glad; a day
that should have
brought smiles to every
one.</p>

<p>But no one smiled at
the Johns’ breakfast
table that morning.
There was no trunk to
pack, for Van wore all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
the clothes he had—just his pretty brown and
white coat and his brass-studded collar. Betsy
did, however, roll up his blanket, as if he were a
soldier on the march, and it was to be taken along,
in case he should be gone during cold weather.</p>

<p>Van capered and looked his gayest, when he
was told that he was to go, for he dearly loved
traveling, and to go with Dr. Johns would be
the greatest fun ever. The good doctor himself
had dropped his important work at the Hospital
to see the sinful Prince safely established at college.</p>

<p>In spite of his chain, Van trotted and pranced,
and almost dragged Dr. Johns off his feet in his
eagerness, as they went down the hill to the trolley-station.</p>

<p>When the conductor had taken the fares, he
came and sat down by Dr. Johns. Van bobbed
up gleefully, as if he and the conductor were on
the best of terms.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Dr. Johns. Hello, Van!
Taking him on a vacation?”</p>

<p>“Hardly a vacation, I am afraid. In fact, it
is quite the contrary. He’s been killing chickens,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
and I’m taking him to Trimble, the trainer, over
in Westchester, to see if he can be cured of the
habit.”</p>

<p>“That so? Well, now, I’m mighty sorry.
He’s a great dog. I’d be glad to own one of
his kind, chickens or no chickens. You see me
and the little fellow are old friends.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? I wish the farmers around here
could talk of him as kindly.”</p>

<p>“They would if they got acquainted with him,
personal. You see, I’ve been running on this
Hospital car ever since he was a puppy. One
day, about a year ago, when he was a little tad,
no bigger’n a pint of cider,—you could put him
in your pocket,—Miss Betsy took him in town on
my car, and he had the time of his life. He sat
on the front seat like a man, and there wasn’t
a house or tree on the line that he didn’t take
in.</p>

<p>“Well, the very next day, at the same hour, I
was startin’ to take my fares, and, if you’ll believe
it, there sat that little scamp, perky and
peart as you please, alone on the front seat, just
where he had sat with Miss Betsy, and lookin’
as if he owned the car. How he got up there I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
don’t know; he was too small to climb. He
must have taken it flying. But there he was as
sassy as a squirrel.”</p>

<p>Dr. Johns laughed. “Did he pay his fare?”</p>

<p>“Not he. I didn’t ask no fares of him. I
let him ride for nothing to the end of the line
and back. Since then he’s had a free ride every
time he asked for it—more times than I can
count. All the car men know him.”</p>

<p>“He seems to make friends easily,” said Dr.
Johns.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! Not as easy as you’d imagine, Doctor.
He gets his ride, and he wags the thing
he calls his tail at us; but none of us ever got
him to follow us. He always beats it up the hill
back home at the end of the trip. Now I’m
mighty sorry he’s gone wrong. He must have
been in bad company. Here you are at the station,
Doctor. Good luck to you. So long, Van!”</p>

<p>Railway cars, too, were an old story to our
hero. This time he sat openly on the red plush
seat, for this conductor also knew Dr. Johns.
The journey was not long. In an hour or two
the brakeman shouted “Westchester!” and the
train stopped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>Dr. Johns and Van climbed down on the wooden
platform of a station at a small country village,
and looked around.</p>

<p>A boy about ten years old, with honest blue
eyes and many freckles, came up and said bashfully,</p>

<p>“This yer’s the dawg?”</p>

<p>“If you are Mr. Trimble’s boy, it is,” said
Dr. Johns.</p>

<p>“Yessir, I’m Mr. Trimble’s Pete. Pa’s gone
away to-day, and he told me to come fer the
dawg.”</p>

<p>“All right, then. Now, this is Van, and you
must take the best of care of him, for he’s a great
pet at home. He has some bad habits that your
father said he could break him of. I think I’ll
go to the house, and see where he is to be;
there is plenty of time before the return train.”</p>

<p>Pete led the way, and Dr. Johns followed, still
holding to Van’s chain. Van gamboled happily
along; there was no hint as yet of what was to
follow. There was a walk of about ten minutes
from the station, past two or three stores, four or
five houses, then sunlit meadows. They paused
at last before a closely latched gate in a high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
fence of palings. Pete unfastened the gate, closing
it carefully after them, as they went in and
up the path to a low frame house, yellow, with
green blinds.</p>

<p>A woman, with a motherly face and eyes like
Pete’s, came to the door.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Trimble, I suppose? I am Dr. Johns,
from the Hospital.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Dr. Johns. We was expectin’ you.
This here is the dawg you wrote about?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mrs. Trimble. This is Vanart VI.
May I see the place where he is to be housed during
his stay?”</p>

<p>“Sure you can,” said Mrs. Trimble, leading
the way. “He will be kept in that kennel right
over there, and there’s clean straw in it.”</p>

<p>Dr. Johns looked around on a yard of ample
proportions, where stood a dozen or so good-sized
kennels, some distance apart. Several of
these were occupied by dogs larger than Van.
These were chained to their kennels separately,
so they could not reach each other. At sight
of Van they set up a chorus of barking and baying
which was quite deafening. Van strained with
all his little might to get at them, for the size<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
of a dog never bothered him. He was no coward.
But he was kept tightly on the chain, and
all acquaintance had to be carried on from a distance.</p>

<p>“Them there is young huntin’ dawgs,” said
Mrs. Trimble. “They’re bein’ trained to hunt
birds. Some is p’inters and some is retrievers and
some is setters. That there is a English setter,
and these two fellers is Irish setters. They’re
about the purtiest of the lot, but they’re all fine
dawgs. We don’t get no mongrels here. I feed
’em, an’ I get to likin’ ’em purty well,” she continued
in her soft voice.</p>

<p>“That there is a blood-hound. He’s bein’
trained to hunt folks. I don’t take much to that
idea, but they’re useful sometimes, to catch criminals.”</p>

<p>Van did not understand what Mrs. Trimble
said, but he liked her. She looked a little like
Mary.</p>

<p>“Take good care of the little fellow, and see
that he is taught not to kill cats and chickens.
I believe he will learn easily if he is properly
taught. He’s had no one to train him at home.”
Dr. Johns looked at the kennel that was to become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
the home of royalty. “You will see that
he is comfortable in the cold weather?”</p>

<p>All this time Pete had been hovering near.
Already the brave, proud head and beautiful,
shapely body had won the boy. Now he spoke:</p>

<p>“He’ll be here in the kennel daytimes. Nights
I guess Pa’ll let him sleep in the house with me.”
Then he added in a burst of confidence, “He’s
sech a purty little feller; I guess he’s some dawg,
too.”</p>

<p>Dr. Johns smiled. Always Van appeared to
get the best of what was offered.</p>

<p>“I shall be glad if you look after him nights,
my boy. He’s a house-pet, and a kennel will be
hard on him at the very best.”</p>

<p>Dr. Johns stooped down and took Vanny-Boy’s
head in his two hands. The little fellow
shivered with a fear of something about to happen,
and looked up, with eyes big and questioning.</p>

<p>“Good-by, little Van. Be brave, and learn
your lessons.”</p>

<p>Dr. Johns turned away, and hurried off down
the road to the station, so that no one should see
his mouth quiver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>And the other end of Van’s chain was in the
hands of little Pete, and Van was left behind!</p>

<p>He stood still, dazed and astonished, until he
saw Dr. Johns disappear around a corner; then
the truth flashed upon him. He had been deserted!</p>

<p>With a leap he started to follow, but the chain
held him. He bounded from side to side, he
jerked, he tugged. He barked, he howled, he
yelped, he whined, he begged. It was all useless.
The chain held, although it took all Pete’s
strength. All the other dogs set up a howl of
sympathy. They had been through the same
sorrow, and not one of them but had grieved
over just such a cruel desertion. This was the
College of the Deserted—the Masterless Dogs.</p>

<p>Pete tried to comfort him, but he would have
none of it. His grief was too new and poignant.
He struggled away, and tried to break the hated
leash. Howl after howl went up. The little
dog who held up such a brave head in the face
of dangers was prostrated by sorrow. But this
was more than sorrow; it was anguish at a betrayal.</p>

<p>“Better chain him to the kennel, Honey,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
Mrs. Trimble. “He might get away. Here, I’ll
help you. My! but he’s a strong little feller!”</p>

<p>Van was dragged across the yard and fastened
securely to the kennel, and for an hour he tugged
vainly at his chain, and rent the air with heart-breaking
howls.</p>

<p>Then he lay down and tried to gnaw the chain
apart, but the steel links hurt his teeth, and made
his mouth bleed. Then he fell to howling once
more.</p>

<p>“Dr. Johns! Dr. Johns!” he seemed to say.
“Take me home to my Betsy! Take me
ho-o-o-ome! Cruel! O cru-u-e-l!”</p>

<p>There was no answer, save the barking from
the other kennels, for Pete had gone about his
daily duties, and could not attend to him. It
was Saturday, his father was away, and Pete
was a manful little boy about helping.</p>

<p>All that miserable September day Van cried
bitterly. It had started so happily, and now had
come this terrible desertion and loneliness and
homesickness. He could not understand, and no
one could tell him why his Betsy did not come
and rescue him. She had never failed him before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>Nightfall came on, and with it came Pete, with
a bit of supper. It was left untouched. Pete sat
on the ground and reasoned with Van.</p>

<p>“Now, you little feller, you jest show yer grit.
I know by your look you got some. You mustn’t
be a baby. You got to show some spunk. Pop
don’t let no dawg take on like that. Ef he was
here he’d lick you and make you stop. Now
you be a good dog, and I’ll take you in the house.”</p>

<p>To the kitchen they went, and there the chain
was slipped, and Van could run free. Straight
to the door he went, and lay down, with his nose
to the crack, where he could smell the outside air,
and there he whined pitifully, until Mrs. Trimble
felt a tear on her own cheek.</p>

<p>“He does take on awful. Try and comfort
him, Honey. Bring him here by the fire, where
it’s warmer. These pet dogs do make a heap of
trouble when they first come.”</p>

<p>“I hope he gets to like me,” said Pete. “He’s
so purty. Come on, Van, and let’s play we’re old
friends.”</p>

<p>By inches Pete succeeded in coaxing Van in
front of the stove, where he sat, grave and silent,
watching the streak of red coals through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
draft, with only now and then a sobbing whimper.
Violent grief cannot last forever. By and
by he lay down alongside, with his nose on Pete’s
knee, and the sad brown eyes closed.</p>

<p>When bedtime came, he followed Pete up to
the garret room, with its sloping sides, and he
spent the night snuggled close to the little boy.
Through the dark hours he forgot his sorrow and
loneliness, forgot that he was a poor, deserted
waif, and in prison; forgot even his dear mistress,
his own Betsy.</p>

<small>VAN’S HARD LESSONS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ANOTHER day or two of vain grieving, and
Van’s gallant spirit began to react, and he
showed more interest in the things around him.
He would eat his food, but he was grave and
solemn, and not at all like the merry rascal the
Johns knew. It was not a bit like living at his
own home, where he had porter-house steak and
liver for his daily food. But he learned that
hunger brings an appetite, and what he had was
good for him, so he soon ate contentedly, as did
the other dogs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>The Trimble house was not large. The upper
story consisted of two bedrooms, Pete’s and another
like it. Downstairs was another bedroom,
the kitchen, the dining-room, the woodshed, and,
crowning glory of all, the “parlor.” Like most
treasures of its kind in the neighborhood, it was
kept with closed shutters, and one’s voice was
lowered a little when one crossed the threshold.
Here Van was seldom allowed to come, nor did
he care much.</p>

<p>Sometimes, on Sunday evenings, when the minister
and his wife came to tea, a fire was lit in
the Franklin stove in this sacred room. Then,
for an hour, until bedtime, Van and Pete would
tread softly over the woollen roses in the carpet,
and sit before the blaze. Sometimes, too, Van
would even lean against the best black skirt of
the minister’s wife, who liked dogs. But these
festive occasions came seldom, and were not so
lovely that Van longed for them. It was all so
different from home, where he ranged the whole
house through, welcome everywhere.</p>

<p>He was no more the proud, haughty little
Prince, with a whole family to wait on him.
Down in his lonely heart he grieved and grieved,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
and often, as he sat in front of his kennel, he
would utter a long-drawn, homesick howl, as he
thought of his Betsy, of Dr. Johns, of Mrs.
Johns, and Mary, and Treesa; of his basket in
the kitchen, and all the comforts of his beloved
Hill-Top.</p>

<p>In the winter evenings he would lie by the dining-room
stove, on one of Pete’s old coats, and
dream sadly of better days. He had really very
little to complain of in the treatment he received.
That his luxuries were few was no fault of the
Trimbles, and indeed he was quite as well off without
them. The great tragedy lay in the chain and
the closed gate; the eternal longing for the old
freedom, the wild rambles through wood and field,
and his dear family.</p>

<p>At bedtime he would be wrapped in his own
blanket that smelled of home, to sleep away the
long nights. At the first crack of dawn he would
stretch himself, yawn, and walk from the foot
of Pete’s bed up to where the little boy’s tousled
head lay on the pillow. There he would paw at
the coverlet until Pete woke up, and let him inside
for one more delicious snooze, before it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
time for Pete to be out helping his father with
the chores.</p>

<p>But this was “College,” and the life he led
was quite secondary to the lessons which he was
there to learn.</p>

<p>Mr. Trimble returned three days after Van’s
arrival. He had been to Boston, and had come
back, bringing with him another dog, who was
chained in front of a kennel just as Van had been,
and who went through the same period of revolt
and frenzy.</p>

<p>Mr. Trimble came over and looked at Van, and
nodded approvingly as he noted the points of the
thoroughbred.</p>

<p>“No doubt about your breeding, young fellow,
but how anybody ever let such a dog as you are
run wild, beats me. Why, you ought to be on
the benches at the shows, taking prizes. Well,
you’ll have to mend your manners; if you stay with
me. But I’ll give you two or three days more to
git acquainted. And then, we’ll see what can be
done with you.”</p>

<p>“You’ll let him stay with me nights, won’t
you, Pop?” Pete was hovering about anxiously.</p>

<p>“Land, yes, ef you want him. It won’t do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
him no hurt, and his trainin’ll only take daytimes.
He’s a house-coddled pet anyway, and spoiled,
like they always are. Hm! I guess his lessons’ll
surprise him some.”</p>

<p>“You won’t hurt him too hard, Pop?”</p>

<p>“Pete, you’ll never make a trainer. You’re
too soft-hearted, like yer Ma. You’ll make a
better husband than me mebbe, but I’ll hev to
learn you another trade. Come, we’ve got to
move them kennels over to the other side of the
yard, where they’ll git the sun in the cold
weather.”</p>

<p>One bright cool morning, Mr. Trimble, after
Pete had gone to school, came out to Van’s kennel,
and unfastened one end of his chain, still
keeping him confined.</p>

<p>“Your lessons begin now, young fellow. You’ll
be wishing you had leather pants in about five
minutes.”</p>

<p>He led Van across the yard, wondering, but
unsuspecting, to another yard full of chickens of
all sizes, from big old roosters, to half-grown
pullets.</p>

<p>“There,” he said, as he undid the chain from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
Van’s collar, “that’ll be your happy home for a
few minutes.”</p>

<p>Van took no note of the fact that Mr. Trimble
had stepped inside the yard and closed the gate,
nor that he was holding his right hand behind
him. Instantly, at the sight of the chickens, all
his old wild instincts came to life within him.
He forgot the changes, he forgot the old punishments
at the Hill-Top, forgot everything, except
that here was sport before him, and plenty of
it.</p>

<p>He seized a nice, well-behaved little pullet,
gave it one shake, dropped it, and turned to find
another, when there before him loomed Mr.
Trimble, large and terrible.</p>

<p>“DOWN, SIR!”</p>

<p>Van looked for Pete to rescue him. Pete was
not there. The gate was closed; there was not
the slightest loophole for escape. He crouched
at Mr. Trimble’s feet, awaiting the punishment
that he knew was coming. He could stand a
whipping. The fun of the crime to him had always
been worth the punishment.</p>

<p>The whipping came, swift and awful; not one
of Betsy’s whippings, nor yet of Dr. Johns’. No,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
indeed! It was like nothing that Van had ever
heard of or dreamed of. Mr. Trimble knew how
to whip so it would be remembered.</p>

<p>Van’s little body writhed with the pain and the
smart of it, but never a sound did he utter, not
the faintest whisper. No soldier ever showed
more grit and courage. No Stoic ever shut his
teeth more grimly and silently. Even as the
lashings fell, Mr. Trimble could not help admiring
that indomitable spirit; but duty must be
done, and it <i>was</i> done.</p>

<p>There was no doubt at all about that whipping.
It was the real thing, and a terrible surprise to
the culprit. Mr. Trimble went away and left him
in the yard, with the dead chicken before him,
and the live ones all around him. For a long
time Van lay without stirring. By and by Mr.
Trimble brought his kennel, and put it beside
him; after a while Van crawled in—a half-dead
bundle of agony—and lay down and licked the
welts, quivering and trembling still with the awful
awakening of his first lesson.</p>

<p>He knew well enough why he had been whipped—the
chicken had hardly ceased breathing when
the whip descended. Just now he did not want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
even to think of chicken; he loathed the whole
species. He was not chained now, he might
range from one end of the chicken-yard to the
other, but he had no such desire. In his shame
he only wanted to crawl off where no one could
ever see him again. He knew at last what a
bad thing it was to kill innocent birds that could
not help themselves.</p>

<p>Mr. Trimble went about other business and left
Van while the punishment soaked into his brain.
The lesson must be thorough or it would do no
good at all.</p>

<p>A little freckled face under a tousled tow thatch
popped through a chink in the gateway. A voice
breathless with running whispered,</p>

<p>“Van! Van! Are you there?”</p>

<p>A tiny, almost inaudible, whine was the answer.</p>

<p>Silently Pete slipped in, dropping his books
inside the gate. He had been on tenter hooks
all the morning, for he knew that this was to
be the day of the “lesson,” and he had run all
the way home. He shut the gate carefully so that
no one might hear.</p>

<p>Two blue eyes looked down pityingly into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
Vanny-Boy’s sad brown ones. The kennel was
large, and Pete slipped in bodily, and took the
aching, trembling sinner tenderly in his arms. He
cuddled the little heaving body close to his own.</p>

<p>“You pore little feller!” he whispered. “I
jest couldn’t stand it. Pop does lick awful sometimes.
An’ it hurts too; <i>I know.</i> I hain’t never
been licked fer killin’ chickens, though, so mebbe
I don’t know the hull of it.</p>

<p>“My! Look at them stripes! I ain’t never
had ’em on me like that.” Tender hands were
feeling all over Van’s little legs and sides. “Now
never you mind, Van, I brought sumpin to make
’em feel better.”</p>

<p>The “sumpin” proved to be a box of soft, oily
stuff that had a queer nice smell. Pete rubbed
it all over the welts, taking great care not to hurt
them any more.</p>

<p>The oily stuff had a very good taste, and Van
licked it all off carefully. Then he snuggled
close to Pete, with his sorrowful head hidden in
the little boy’s shirt.</p>

<p>“Now you jest git up as clost as you like, an’
go ter sleep an’ forgit all about it. I’ll stay with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
you, and don’t you feel bad. I’m right here, and
I’ll take keer of you.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Trimble called Pete for the noon-day
meal. There was no response. She had her suspicions,
however, went out, and peeped into the
kennel. There they lay, fast asleep, the tousled
tow head and the smooth brown one, close together,
the doggie still breathing in sobbing gasps,
but comforted.</p>

</figure>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the afternoon
Van’s
kennel was put
back into its old
place, and he lay
there all day,
sick, exhausted,
and miserable.</p>

<p>Next morning
he was turned
loose once more
in the chicken-yard,
and Mr.
Trimble stayed
outside. There
was no one to interfere; Van
might have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
killed the whole flock, for anything that he could
see to hinder. He never glanced at them—not
even at the smallest broiler. He was sick
of even the very thought of chickens. He lay
down by the gate in the sun, and licked the still
smarting seams on his sides.</p>

<p>Roosters strutted proudly past him; old hens
scratched placidly in the dirt all around him; the
young ones came and went right under his very
nose—it was all the same to him. One lesson was
thoroughly learned; and although for eight long
months afterward he spent an hour every morning
in the yard with the chickens, never again was
he known to touch one.</p>

<p>Always, always, in Van’s lonely heart was the
thought of home and his beloved little mistress.
But with a chain at the kennel, a high fence all
around the place, and a spring lock on the gate,
there was not much chance of escape.</p>

<p>So Van sat at the door of his kennel, or in the
chicken-yard, watching the gate where Dr. Johns
had disappeared, and he grieved and grieved.
The days went by, the weeks and the months.
Winter passed, the ice and snow melted, and the
spring came blithely in. The grass grew, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
days became warm and soft. The April rains
fell, and the sun dried the puddles. The blossoms
came out of their buds, and turned the
peach trees pink and the pear trees white. Mrs.
Trimble’s daffodils came up, gay and yellow, and
Pete began to help his father in the garden-plot.
There were little chickens in the yard, now, but
although Van spent his hour there each day, he
utterly ignored their existence.</p>

<p>One day was like another to him, as he sat listless
in the sunshine, or lay in his kennel when it
rained, looking off over the far hills out beyond
the fence-palings. He was wishing, wishing,
always wishing; wondering if he would ever
be a prince again, and if Dr. Johns would ever
come through the gate and take him home.</p>

<p class="center">*<span class="gap"> *</span><span class="gap"> *</span><span class="gap"> *</span><span class="gap"> *</span></p>

<p>“Good morning, Trimble.”</p>

<p>Mr. Trimble turned his head; he was just setting
Van loose among the chickens. A strange
man came toward him leading a dog that was to
be a new boarder at the College. Together
they turned toward the kennels, and were soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
busy over plans and directions for the treatment
of the latest arrival.</p>

<p>Was it Chance that made Mr. Trimble forget
to latch the gate of the chicken-yard? And was
it Providence that made the stranger close the
outer gate so gently that the spring did not fly
back?</p>

<p>An eager brown head pushed the chicken-yard
gate just far enough to let a little brown and
white body through; a streak like lightning passed
from this to the other gate; a click, and the spring
did its duty; but Van was <i>outside</i>!</p>

<p>Mr. Trimble looked around, looked again, and
through the palings he saw a flying shadow, heading
westward down the road into the unknown.
It was useless to call. What dog on earth would
come back to the call of an alien master, when he
had a Betsy to be hunted for the whole world
over?</p>

<p>That homing instinct of the dog! Who can
understand it? Not we humans, who have our
finer senses dulled and blunted by civilization.
Neither can we understand the ways of that marvelous
little bird, the carrier-pigeon, who will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
travel hundreds of miles, straight as the arrow
flies, back to his home.</p>

<p>Van was free! Free, after eight long months
of dull imprisonment! Free! And nothing on
earth but death could stop him now. It was a
long road, longer than he dreamed, but Betsy
was somewhere at the end of it. He would find
her and his dear home!</p>

<p>And Mr. Trimble? He was in a state, to be
sure. He left the new dog and its master standing
open-mouthed, while he ran as he had not run
before in years, to the grocery-store near the station.
He seized the telephone receiver, and this
message went humming over the wires to the nearest
town that lay between Westchester and the
Hospital:</p>

<p>“Hello! Hello! I want 569 Wilmington.
No, 5-6-9! Yes,—in a hurry!—Hello! That
you, Stubbs? All right. Now listen! If you see
a fox-terrier,—white, with a brown head and
saddle,—going through your town, head him off
and keep him for me. Name on his collar is
Vanart VI. He slipped out and got away from
me. Get that all right? All right. He’ll be
along, if he doesn’t get lost, in about two hours or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
sooner, if he keeps on going like he’s going now.
Thanks! Hope you get him. Call him ‘Van.’
Maybe he’ll come so you can catch him easy, if
you act friendly. So long!”</p>

<p>So the news traveled ahead, but Van knew
nothing about that. He kept on, with his nose
pointed homeward, always homeward.</p>

<p>Out of Westchester he went under full head of
steam. There were no neighbors with telephones
to stop him along the way, and the road was clear.
Past meadows and farmhouses, through still forests
and thickets of green laurel, wading and leaping
across boggy lowlands and scaling rocky highlands,
ever he ran on.</p>

<p>A hedge-hog stared stolidly at him from the
roadside; a chipmunk sputtered from a stone
wall; Van never noticed them. A cat with four
kittens basked temptingly on a hitching-block—Van
might have been blind for all he saw of
them.</p>

<p>By and by he tired a little, and slackened his
pace, as if he realized that a long journey cannot
be continued at top speed, but he did not stop.
Now the long Main Street of Wilmington<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
stretched out before him, and he entered the town
at a steady trot.</p>

<p>Down past pleasant houses under stately rows
of elms he went. A boy at a stable door called
out, “Hey, there, Van!” A child stooped to pat
him, and said, “Hello, Van!” He barked, as if
to say, “My business leads me elsewhere,” and
kept on.</p>

<p>A man stepped out of a corner grocery shop,
and held out his hand.</p>

<p>“Here, Van! Here, Van! Good doggie!
Come here!”</p>

<p>Van stopped still and looked hard at the man.
Could he be an old friend? No, that was surely
a stranger. Van edged away as the man reached
for his collar, and bobbing his head with a side-long
jerk, was off again down the road.</p>

<p>“Hey! Ketch that dawg!” shouted the grocery
man, and the cry was taken up all along the
street. Men, boys, and women all turned out to
chase or head off the fugitive. Everybody was
yelling: “Van! Van! here, you!” for the news
of the runaway had been spread abroad in the
village before his arrival. Never was dog so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
enthusiastically greeted by a whole village of entire
strangers. Van smelled treachery.</p>

<p>A friendly gate stood open, and he dodged in
to avoid a too eager boy. Down to the rear of
the lot he raced. Alas! It ended it an open
stable door. Here the breathless Stubbs pounced
upon him, and he was captured.</p>

<p>“There, you little rascal, I’ve got you!” panted
Stubbs. He was fat, and dog-catching is perspiring
work. “You’ve given me a pretty chase, but
you’ll be back at Trimble’s by night, I reckon.</p>

<p>“Now what did you run away for? Trimble’s
a good fellow, and you hadn’t ought to give him
trouble,—not to mention the shaking up you’ve
give me. Come on, and we’ll get a chain on you,
so we can keep you till Trimble gets here.”</p>

<p>Van kept very still. He was thinking what
he should do next. He gave a little shudder when
Stubbs said “chain.” He knew that word, and
just what it meant.</p>

<p>Stubbs tucked him under his arm. This seemed
like a very tractable dog indeed. Stubbs reached
up to mop his bald head with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>Van felt the loosened tension, and with a sudden
jerk backward, he wriggled out of the man’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
arm, and out of his own collar. In a twinkling
he was going like Time-on-a-holiday, westward.
In a few minutes Main Street and his pretended
friends were left far behind, and he was out in
the open country.</p>

<p>All day he traveled—now fast, when the fear
of capture spurred him; now slow, when his
aching legs and muscles cried out to him. He
was hungry and thirsty, but he dared not stop and
beg a drink, for fear some one might catch him
again. The sun was dropping behind the hills
when he felt that he could not drag himself another
foot. He was passing a tiny farmhouse
hidden away in the hills. There was a delicious
odor wafted to him, and he heard a suggestive,
sizzling sound. He certainly could not resist
that. Yet he dared not make a noise. He
crouched by the gateway.</p>

<p>A little boy about Pete’s size, with the same
blue eyes and tow hair, came up the road, driving
a solitary cow. As he turned in at the gate, he
almost stumbled over a poor, panting, tired little
dog, who lay crumpled in a heap, with mouth
agape, and dry tongue lolling from between his
teeth. He wore no collar, and with the dust of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
the road soiling his white coat, no one would ever
have suspected him to be a prince.</p>

<p>“Why, hello!” said the boy. “What you doin’
here? You look tired to death. Come here and
speak to me.”</p>

<p>He held out his hand; but Van had been caught
once that day, and lay still. He whined a little.</p>

<p>“You pore little tyke, I bet you’re hungry.
Have you been runnin’ away? Now, see here, I
ain’t goin’ to tell on ye, and ef you’ll stay right
here I’ll bring ye half my supper.”</p>

<p>Van lay exhausted in the fence-corner, and
presently the boy slipped out with a large slice
of bread and butter, and a bit of bacon, and, best
of all, a bowl of cold water.</p>

<p>Ah, but that water was good! Van lapped it
thirstily, every drop. Then he fell upon the
bacon and the bread and butter, as greedily as
the veriest tramp that ever lived.</p>

<p>“My! Ye shore was hungry,” said the boy.
“I’d git ye more ef I dasted to; anyways, ye
won’t starve. Landy! I’d like to keep ye, but
Pa wouldn’t let me. Anyways, ef ye’ll come with
me, I’ll fix ye up a bed.”</p>

<p>Van followed the boy that looked like Pete<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
into a dilapidated barn. The boy doubled an old
horse blanket in a corner of the hay-mow.</p>

<p>“Ye kin sleep there, and ye kin git out in the
mornin’ through that busted board. There!
Jinks! I wish’t you’d stay with me. I’d like to
keep ye, awful. I wish’t Pa liked dawgs.”</p>

<p>Up in that hill-cabin home the little boy’s hungry
heart yearned to the starved heart of the
runaway Prince, and he stooped and kissed him.
Then he drew away, as if ashamed, even in the
dusk, of so silly an action, and went back to the
house, trying to whistle.</p>

<p>Van slept without stirring, until the cold fingers
of the dawn made him stretch his stiffened limbs,
and realize that he was in a strange land, and that
he must be getting on to his home on the Hill-Top.
He stole out through the broken board,
and was off in the gray of the morning, breakfastless
but rested.</p>

<p>And it was westward ho! through the chilling
mists, and westward ho! when the sun rose at his
back to warm and cheer him. It was westward
ho! when the sun shone high and hot above his
head, and his mouth was dry and parched again,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
and his legs moved slowly and stiffly, as if he had
aged ten years.</p>

<p>Now his road dropped suddenly over a hillside;
down it wound and wound, till Van thought
he would never reach the bottom that was hidden
by the forest that bent over him on all sides. It
was a wild, deep glen. But far below there was
the sound of rushing, gurgling water!</p>

<p>He pricked up his drooping ears. A minute
ago he had felt that he was like to die, but there
was life calling to him again.</p>

<p>Above his head stretched a vast railway trestle,
over which a train was crawling, with groans and
screams of iron wheels on iron rails. That might
be a wonderful thing to men, but nothing called
to Van but the singing stream and his own Betsy.</p>

<p>He dropped down, down, to the lowest level of
the gully, and stretched himself flat on the green
moss, with his hot nose in the laughing water.
Oh, it was good! He drank and drank till his
thirsty body was satisfied, and his tongue grew
cool, and like a real tongue, instead of like a slab
of fire in his mouth. He drank till he wanted no
more. Then he fell asleep on a heap of leaves,
a long deep sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>All the afternoon he lay there. The sun set,
the stars came out, and a little moon climbed high
and looked down into the ravine; shining white
on the heaving body of a lonely waif of a dog,
collarless, homeless and piteous. The little moon
traveled on and followed the sun over the hill,
and out of sight. The stars grew pale and the
dawn of another morning trembled in the forest
aisles. Down along the stream lay a thick, icy
fog, like a long roll of cotton batting.</p>

<p>Van, waking at last from that long sleep,
looked out into the mist, dazed and lost and shivering.
Slowly his senses came back to him. His
stomach cried out to him that he had had nothing
to eat since the night before last; his legs told
him that they had carried him faithfully and far,
but that they could not last forever; and then
his homing instinct told him that he must cross
that little roaring stream if he would follow the
road that led across the world to his little mistress.</p>

<p>What mattered that old hatred of water now?
In he plunged, and the rushing current carried
his weak, struggling body far along before he
could make the farther shore. But make it he
did. He crawled up on a shelving curve, dragged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
himself out, shook the water from his shivering
sides, and started off on a run that warmed him
and saved him from a chill.</p>

<p>The run changed to a weary plod before he
reached the top of the ravine, but he kept on—westward,
always westward! Wood, hill, valley,
farm, forest again—he went by them with only
one thought. On the road he picked up a crust
of bread, dropped by some schoolboy, and devoured
it greedily.</p>

<p>Through another town. Here he went warily,
dodging everybody. He passed through safely,
and journeyed on and on. If only his strength
could last until he reached home!</p>

<p>There was another town ahead. He approached
it cautiously. There was a something
familiar about it. The streets had a smell that
brought some memory to his numbing faculties.</p>

<p>Now, in the gathering twilight he found himself
stumbling across a great bridge that spanned
a wide, flowing river, and the lights of still another
town fell down deep into its limpid depths
like golden piles.</p>

<p>Ho, ho! Surely he had crossed that bridge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
before, in his wild wanderings of other days!
Surely, surely! He went a little faster.</p>

<p>And now he knew—on the farther side lay his
own home-town. It was a short half-hour’s run,
when one was feeling fine, to the Hill-Top,—and
HOME!</p>

<p>HOME! The thought spurred his lagging
feet. Down through the dear old streets where
he had often trotted so gaily went Van. He had
no thought for them now. “Betsy! Betsy!” his
heart breathed; and that alone kept him going.</p>

<p>An attendant from the Hospital noticed him
and turned to watch him as he wavered out of
sight.</p>

<p>“If that dog was fatter and pearter and cleaner
and had a collar on, I’d say it was Van, even if
I knew that he was in another part of the
country.”</p>

<p class="center">*<span class="gap"> *</span><span class="gap"> *</span><span class="gap"> *</span><span class="gap"> *</span></p>

<p>Betsy sat on the steps of the honeysuckle porch
in the soft May night, with the young moon silvering
the glossy leaves around her. She was
thinking of the changes that had come to her,—of
the red house up in Wixon’s Hollow, now so
far away. She wondered a little what had become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
of her father, but she did not trouble her
soul very deeply; she remembered him only as
one to dread and hide from. Then she thought
of all that Aunt Kate had done to make her more
like gentlefolk, of the lessons she had learned
in the care of both soul and body.</p>

<p>Indeed, could she have compared her old self
to the little white-clad figure with its soft halo
of hair, its sweet fragrance of cleanliness, its
childish grace and dignity, that had grown to be
unconscious of itself, she would not have recognized
the Betsy of two years ago. There was
much yet to learn, but with so lovely a teacher
as Aunt Kate, who could fail of doing her best?</p>

<p>Then she wondered how it fared with little
Van. Would he come back from College like the
knights of old from their quests, bearing a badge
of honor? When would he come, and did he
remember her and long for her as she longed for
him? She sighed a bit of a sigh.</p>

<p>The sigh was echoed below her! She looked
down, startled.</p>

<p>Something small and white dragged itself out
of the dark, and stretched along the ground at
her feet, flat, as if life had gone out of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>Betsy stooped and touched it, once, then she
gathered it in her arms.</p>

<p>Van opened his tired eyes, kissed Betsy’s thumb,
said “Woof!” and settled back contentedly.</p>

<p>He was home again, and his college days were
over!</p>

<p class="center">*<span class="gap"> *</span><span class="gap"> *</span><span class="gap"> *</span><span class="gap"> *</span></p>

<p>Out on the lawn a dark figure watched until
the light flared up in Betsy’s room. Then the
man shook his fist and muttered, as he slowly
slouched away and disappeared in the night,</p>

<p>“Ef that cur hadn’t happened along, I’d ’a’ had
her where she couldn’t holler. Courts, indeed!
They’ve got me down here to try an’ prove that
my own flesh and blood ain’t mine, an’ I can’t do
what I choose with ’er. That Johns feller thinks
he can rob me by proving that I ain’t fit. I’ll
show him one thing I know about law. <i>Possession</i>
is nine points of the law, and I guess he’ll
squirm when he finds that I’ve clinched the tenth
point. I guess Bet’ll come down from her high
horse a mite. I’ve waited about long enough. I’ll
show ’em!”</p>

<small>VAN THE RESCUER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was a June morning; the air was soft, still,
and windless. Betsy came out on the honeysuckle
porch carrying a basket of lunch. Van lay
there in the sweet sunshine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>“School is over and vacation has begun, Vanny-Boy,
and Aunt Kate says we may have a picnic,
if you’ll take good care of me. We’re going up
to the Reservoir, and we’re going for a whole
day. We are going to have the time of our lives.
Now, what do you think of that?”</p>

<p>With a bark of joy he began dancing around
her, and all the way past the buildings he measured
the rods with little yelps of delight. Freedom
was his once more, and gladness radiated
from him in every direction. Eastward, up Bow
Lane they turned, Van always in the lead, while
straying cats and chickens no longer needed to
flee at his approach.</p>

<p>A sleepy, winding road was Bow Lane, making
a great curve past meadows and farmhouses, till
it lost itself in the hills. A golden glow filled all
the valley ahead of them, and the hills rose out
of the mist like dreams, barely outlined in delicate
amethyst against the glory of the sky. Down
into a ravine they went, where a brook sang its
morning song far below the bridge that spanned
it. Here Van leaped from rock to rock down the
steep bank to the very edge of the little stream,
and lapped his fill of the sweet water. Across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
the brook he bounded, never wetting his feet,
then up the other side as if he were a winged
thing, till he joined Betsy once more.</p>

<p>Up the brook a little way, on a boulder, sat a
tramp, who started as he saw the dog, and then
looked up to watch the little girl as she crossed
the bridge. But Betsy did not see him, and Van
only gave a contemptuous bark in his direction.</p>

<p>On and on they went, up the brown road that
unwound itself out of the mist between two lines
of velvety green. The country swam higher and
higher out of the vapor, and resolved itself into
fields of standing corn, wheat, or clover, that
spread everywhere, dew-pearled. The rainbow
ropes that bound earth to sky spun themselves up,
up, till the dreaming hills turned from amethyst
to sapphire, then emerald.</p>

<p>Out of the fog that veiled the upland, sprang
an army of tall, thin cedar trees, standing like
soldiers, singly or in groups. They appeared to
be marching up the hill in a happy-go-lucky way,
as if it were not necessary to keep rank and step
when armies go on a holiday. Betsy saluted
gayly as she passed, and it almost seemed as if
they returned the salute and presented arms, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
friendly did the whole world appear that lovely
morning.</p>

<p>Now Betsy and Van plunged through a grove
of chestnuts and beeches, where the road looked
like a tunnel of green, opening into fairyland.
Beyond lay a fallow field. Here they left the
road, and waded knee-deep through grass and
flowers hung from tip to tip with filmy fairy garments,
tended by spidery washerwomen.</p>

<p>Betsy laughed at her soaked shoes, and shook
defiance at the dew with her short skirts. Van
cared for nothing except to race hither and
yonder, covering ten feet of distance to Betsy’s
one, until he was halted by a mass of rock too
high and steep for him to clamber over. He
looked back to see what his mistress would do in
the face of such an obstacle. But Betsy knew the
secret, and instead of trying to climb, she simply
skirted the foot of the rocks until she came to an
opening, where a narrow, grassy path led around
the barrier, and there before them lay the
miracle!</p>

<p>A great limpid opal, in whose bosom were reflected
the white rocks and tall forests of the hill-summit,
every pebble, every leaf, hanging from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
the shore-line, as perfect in the reflection as in
the reality. Oh, this was surely a morning to
lose all sight of the border-land between the Land
of Everyday and the Land of Faery! This was
the Reservoir, made by the hand of God to store
water, cool, clear, and wonderful, for man’s use.
Betsy’s delight grew in thrills as she settled herself
under an overhanging rock, to take in the
marvel of it.</p>

<p>“Now, Van, you can turn yourself upside down
and inside out. There’s a squirrel! You may
chase him, if you want to, and there’s a butterfly,
and you may chase him, too. Only don’t go
off and leave me.”</p>

<p>What a morning that was! Every minute full
of new delights, and all too short. Hunger
pressed them at an early hour to take their nooning,
and they refreshed themselves with the contents
of the basket, and drank tin cups of nectar
from the opalescent pool. Van sat up and begged
and did every trick he knew in payment for the
largess with which Betsy rewarded him. He even
risked his life doing “Dead Dog,” for he did it
in the face of a piece of doughnut, and with such
absolute abandon that he started rolling down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
the bank, and was only saved from being really a
dead dog, or rather, a wet one, by Betsy, who
clutched him just as he was going over the edge.</p>

<p>A thin film of gray had drawn itself over the
sky until the gold was all gone, and the sun had
quite disappeared. The air had grown hot and
breathless.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll take a rest,” said Betsy at last.
“It’s as still as anything up here.”</p>

<p>She curled herself up in a grassy hollow where
the early sun had dried the dew, and Van also
curled himself comfortably on her skirt, and was
soon in the Happy Hunting Ground of Dreams.</p>

<p>A strange stillness settled over the place; nothing
stirred save an uneasy bird in the thicket
across the pool; the pool itself became a gray
pearl in a setting of silence. Everything in the
world seemed asleep, and Betsy caught the general
drowsiness, closed her eyes, and passed off
into visions of Elfland.</p>

<p>Presently she awoke. She felt a curious sensation,
as if some one was watching her. Van gave
a low growl. She rose to her knees, looked
around, and saw a man looking down at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>Suddenly her heart stood still, and her breath
caught in her throat. She looked again.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Bet!”</p>

<p>“Pa!” said Betsy.</p>

<p>“Sure it is. It took ye some time to recognize
yer dad. Wasn’t expectin’ the pleasure, was ye?
My! but ye look as neat as a cotton hat. Yer
Aunt Kate’s dolled ye up mighty fine. But <i>she</i>
can’t hev ye. Ye are goin’ to come along with
<i>me</i>. I need ye. I jest been waitin’ till I caught
ye off by yerself. They beat me in court this
mornin’, but I seen ye comin’ up here afore they
done it, and now, by gum, I’ll beat <i>them</i>!”</p>

<p>All Betsy’s heart rose in revolt—to go back to the
old days of hunger and rags and beatings!
This was not her father. It was the man who
had killed her mother by leaving her to starve.</p>

<p>“I’m not going with you,” said Betsy, sturdily.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, ye air.”</p>

<p>“I won’t go. You went off and left us, and Ma
died, and I ’most did. You aren’t my father any
longer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I am, Miss H’ighty-t’ighty, an’ I’d
like to hear any one else say I ain’t. A child’s
duty is to its dad, and ye air goin’ to come right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
along with me, and the Court kin go to kingdom
come. I got ye a nice new ma, and she’ll curl yer
hair fer ye. Ye won’t need yer Aunt Kate.”</p>

<p>Betsy stood aghast. She could not speak for
the horror of it all. This father who, in the old
days, had beaten her for little or nothing, who
had deserted his family, leaving them in the face
of dire poverty, taking with him all the money
in the house, now claimed her. She was not so
young that she had not known and understood
it all. She summoned up all the strength of her
eleven years.</p>

<p>“I won’t go, I tell you!”</p>

<p>“An’ I’d like to see ye help yerself.” He
seized and lifted her from the ground with no
effort.</p>

<p>“Ye ain’t much weight. I kin manage ye all
right. Keep still, will ye!”</p>

<p>Betsy kicked and screamed and struggled.</p>

<p>“Now, let up, there. Ye kin kick and screech,
but ’twon’t do ye no good; there ain’t no one to
hear ye.”</p>

<p>Van, who had been keeping up a low growling,
thought this was the cue for him to enter. With
a leap he caught the man’s leg in his teeth, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
held on with all the strength and tenacity of that
bull-dog ancestor of his.</p>

<p>“Leggo,—you!” snarled the man, but Van held
on valiantly.</p>

<p>“You call off that dog, Bet, or I’ll kill him,
and I’ll lam-bast you!”</p>

<p>Betsy, thoroughly frightened for her pet, made
Van let go; but her heart was so full of anger
that any thought of fear for herself was banished.
She only felt that she must keep still, and not
make things worse. She must think, hard.</p>

<p>“Make that dog go home!”</p>

<p>“Home, Van! Go home!”</p>

<p>Van slunk to the rear, but Betsy, looking back,
saw him standing, grieved and bewildered. Then,
after a minute he disappeared.</p>

<p>“Ye kin walk ef ye like, but I’ll keep an eye on
ye, and a hand, too.”</p>

<p>Half leading, half dragging her, Al Wixon
went deeper into the forest on the far side of the
pool. A trackless way it was, but they came out
at last in a tiny clearing where stood a hut, apparently
deserted. It was, in fact, only a wooden
shanty that had been built for temporary shelter
near an abandoned quarry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>“There! I’ll hive ye up here till I git my things
and come back. Ye can’t git out, and it’s no use
to holler. No one kin hear ye. We’ll start to-night,
and work along up New York State and
into Canady, and then ye kin sing fer yer Aunt
Kate. I reckon ye thought ye was goin’ to be
made a lady of, did ye? Gosh! Ye air growin’
purty! Look like yer ma used ter, a leetle mite.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you speak of my mother to me,—you——!”</p>

<p>“He, he! Spitfire! Well, I kin lick that out’n
ye when we git to Canady. Now set easy, and ef
you yip, I’ll take yer head off! I’ll be back afore
night. I got to git some duffle I left in town.”</p>

<p>Al Wixon’s footfalls died away, and Betsy
drew a longer breath and looked around. There
was only one window and a door. The window
was nailed up on the outside, and the door, too,
was fastened on the outside with two bars put
rudely across. The window had only one pane
of glass, anyway, and was too small to crawl
through, even if the glass were broken.</p>

<p>Betsy leaned against the door to think. She
would be taken away, and would never see Aunt
Kate and Uncle Ben again. And Van would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
left behind. Where was the little comrade now?</p>

<p>“Oh, Vanny-Boy!” she wailed.</p>

<p>Sh! What was that? She listened. A
scratching sound, and then a little whine on the
other side of the door.</p>

<p>“Van!” she whispered. “Oh, my little Van,
are you there?”</p>

<p>The answer was a desperate scratching in the
dirt under the door, which had no sill. Betsy
could hear the dirt fly, as Van worked madly to
get in to his mistress. An inspiration leaped in
her brain.</p>

<p>“He’s digging under to get in to me. Why
can’t I dig, and get out to him?”</p>

<p>It was the one chance. She looked around the
bare little room. Nothing there, except a small
rusted stove in one corner, now falling to pieces,
and the floor was simply the dirt of the clearing.
Not a thing to dig with. Yes, there was one
thing, the lid on the top of the little stove. It
was red and eaten with rust, but still stout enough
for service.</p>

<p>“Now,” she said, as she settled to work, “we’ll
make the hole big enough in no time, and if Pa
doesn’t get back too soon!——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>She wasted no more breath on words. The old
stove-lid proved an effective instrument in the
light earth. Together they worked; Betsy inside
and Van outside the old door. If her father came
back before the hole was big enough, he might
kill Van, and she would never get back to the
Hill-Top. Desperately she worked; her breath
coming in little sobbing gasps that caught and
choked her. With nervous, trembling hands she
dug down, and down. The ground had been
packed by the tramp of the quarry-men in days
past, but the earth-worms had lightened the soil a
little, and it was possible, even with the mean
tool she held, to dig into it.</p>

<p>Soon a black muzzle was in sight; a few more
strokes on either side, and Van had wriggled
through and was in her aching arms.</p>

<p>But she must not stop. She must keep on digging.
Van seemed to understand. He did not
bark, but stood, alert and eager, waiting.</p>

<p>Now Betsy could get her head through the
hole, now her shoulders; then a few more frantic
strokes of the old stove-lid, and she dragged her
whole body through the opening. Her pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
dress was torn and earthstained, but she was
<i>free</i>!</p>

<p>A light rain was beginning to fall; she did
not mind that, only there were no long afternoon
shadows to point the way home, and even the
little country-bred Betsy was quite lost. Which
way should she turn? In any case she must get
out of the clearing and into the woods where her
father could not find her.</p>

<p>She started to run to shelter, but Van gave a
short, quick bark, and ran in the other direction.
Then he came back, and off again, as if he would
have her follow him.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he knows,” thought Betsy. She
turned and followed him across the clearing and
into the forest.</p>

<p>And Van did know. Many a time he had
scoured those woods with Thatcher, and even if
he had never had been there before, he could
have followed his own trail back. With his nose
to the ground, he started into a gully, looking
back to see that his mistress was coming; then
down a rocky hill into a place so dark that it
seemed as if the twilight had already come. Now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
up and out, through some burned ground, over a
brook, through a long stretch of unbroken wood,
and then, before them lay the Reservoir, its gray
mirror broken into millions of tiny ripples by
the falling raindrops.</p>

<p>Beyond lay the field of the cedar soldiers, on
guard. Betsy knew the way now, although the
dusk was gathering. Across the valley she could
see the Hospital buildings looming, and the lights
as they flashed up in the corridors.</p>

<p>Something was coming! Was it her father returning?
She must hide. Crouching behind a
boulder and holding Van’s muzzle she waited.</p>

<p>A man bearing a pack on his back slouched
past, and went on up the road they had just
traveled. Betsy’s heart stopped pounding as he
disappeared. She started once more on her journey,
but drew back as another sound was heard.
Listen! That was a carriage, surely. In the
waning light Betsy peered from behind a tree,
and then leaped to meet the coming vehicle.</p>

<p>They were both there, Uncle Ben and Aunt
Kate, bundled up in mackintoshes. Aunt Kate
sprang to the ground, and straight into her arms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
ran a bedraggled, wet little figure, while Van
leaped in ecstasies.</p>

<p>“My darling! My own child!”</p>

<p>“Auntie Kate, Uncle Ben! Oh, Auntie Kate,
Pa tried to get me, and he shut me up and Van
scratched me out.” In a flame of words, tears,
and laughter the whole story was poured out.</p>

<p>They drove home through the gathering night
and falling rain, Betsy tucked in the middle, and
Van at her feet. Presently Betsy asked,</p>

<p>“He couldn’t have me, could he, Auntie Kate?”</p>

<p>“No, dear. And we have something to tell
you; it was to have crowned a happier day than
this. But the end is all right. The court has
decided the matter. The man who was your
father will never dare come again, and Uncle
Ben and I have legally adopted you, so now you
are our very own little girl. This was Alvin
Wixon’s last effort, after his failure before the
judge.”</p>

<p>Betsy slipped an arm around each of the two
who were beside her.</p>

<p>“Why, then,—you are my father and mother,—and—My!
but I’m glad!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>“And you are not Betsy Wixon any more.
From now on you are Betsy Johns.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Auntie Kate—Mother!” whispered
Betsy.</p>

<p>The heart of Betsy was unlocked now, forever.</p>

<p>It seems peculiarly fitting that this, the tercentenary
of Shakespeare’s death, should be marked by the
publication of a Shakespeare play for children. And
such this is. In a prologue, three acts and an epilogue,
Mrs. Garnett has succeeded in telling a story
of much charm, and a story, moreover, which children
will delight to see and to act. The play centers around
the boy Shakespeare in his home in Stratford, relating
his remarkable experiences, in reality a dream, on New
Year’s Eve. The characters which are introduced, in
addition to Will, include Sir Thomas Lucy, Shakespeare’s
mother, Queen Elizabeth, Oberon, Titania, and
fairies and witches.</p>

<p>“A delightful play.”—<i>The Independent.</i></p>

<p>“The chief delight of the drama is its delicate fancy,
a certain misty dream quality which can only be the
work of a person of fine imagination.”—<i>Drama.</i></p>

<p>This play for children, selected from hundreds of
manuscripts submitted in the contest, won the prize
offered by the Drama League of America. The story
of a princess who remains true to her ideals despite
the temptations of circumstances and the obstacles
which seek to prevent her from fulfilling her duty to
the people over whom she rules. In the end she is
happily rewarded, as is natural for so steadfast a
heroine. The play is of the sort which children enjoy
giving as well as seeing.</p>

is further extended. It is the purpose of this series to present books for boys and
girls which have been approved as suitable reading by those who have made a study
of fiction for children. Only those books the influence of which is undoubtedly of
the right kind are included. While this purpose is not lost sight of, neither is the
child’s point of view neglected. The stories are without exception of that entertaining
character that appeals strongly to the youngsters for whom they were written.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

<h2 id="pg-footer-heading">THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE</h2>

<div class="agate">PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
</div><div>
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div><div>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div><div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div><div>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.
</div><div>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.
</div><div>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div><div>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:
</div><ul>
    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul><div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
